==============================
Configure Multiple Storefronts
==============================

CS-Cart allows you to manage multiple stores with one administration panel. Stores have separate storefronts,  settings, and checkout mechanisms, so that visitors can treat them as independent. This section of the documentation describes how to configure multiple stores.

.. note::
    If you want to manage multiple stores with one administration panel, you’ll need to `purchase additional storefront licenses <http://www.cs-cart.com/cs-cart-storefront-license.html>`_ or specify the desired number of storefronts when you `buy a CS-Cart license <http://www.cs-cart.com/cs-cart-license.html>`_.
