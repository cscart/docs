Products
********

Products are what customers come for to an online store or marketplace. Administrators can create, update, or delete products; customers see those products on the storefront (not through API) and can buy them. In API, a product can become a part of :doc:`Cart<carts>` or :doc:`Order<orders>`.

Some similar products (those that have different variants of a specific :doc:`Product Feature<product_features>`) can become :doc:`Product Variations<product_variations>` through :doc:`Product Variation Groups<product_variation_groups>`. That allows customers to select the desired product feature on the storefront, and go to the page of specific variation.

List All Products
=================

To get a list of products, send a ``GET`` request to ``/api/products/``::

  GET /api/products/


The number of the returned products is determined by the ``items_per_page`` parameter. Its value can be changed in Admin panel in **Settings → Appearance** in the **Elements per page** setting or through an API request. 


To refer to all products of a particular :doc:`Category <categories>` send a ``GET`` request to  ``/api/categories/:id/products/``::

  GET /api/categories/166/products/

Pagination, Sorting and Filtering
---------------------------------


Add these parameters to the path to specify which products will be returned in the response and how they will be organized.

.. note::

    The CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor REST API always accepts and returns data as strings and arrays/objects. The **Default value** column in the table merely shows what kind of data you can expect in the fields.

================
Create a Product
================     

.. list-table::
    :stub-columns: 1
    :widths: 5 15
    
    *   -   Store Builder
        -   Send a POST request to ``/api/stores/<company_id>/products/``
    *   -   Multi-Vendor
        -   Send a POST request to ``/api/products/``


To create a new product, send a ``POST`` request with required fields in JSON:  ``category_ids``, ``product``.

------------------------------
Example JSON: Create a Product 
------------------------------

::

    {
    "product": "Product Name",
    "category_ids": "166",
    "price": "1000"
    }


This request creates a product with minimum required details: a name, a main category ID and a price.

------------------------------------------------------
Example JSON: Create a Product for a Particular Vendor 
------------------------------------------------------

:doc:`Vendors <vendors>` are independent companies that sell their own products in your marketplace. To create a product for a specific Vendor you will need to add their **vendor_id** in a request.
 
Send a POST request to   ``api/vendors/1/products``::

    {
    "product": "Vendor's Product Name",
    "category_ids": "166",
    "price": "1000"
    }
    
This request creates a product for the Vendor with a ``vendor_id=1`` and minimum Product Details.

--------------------------------------------
Example JSON: Create a Product with Images
--------------------------------------------

.. important::
    A product can have multiple images. You can specify them in the ``image_pairs`` object. It must come before the ``main_pair`` object with the main product image.




::

    {
    "product": "Product Name",
    "category_ids": "166",
    "price": "1000",
    "image_pairs":
    {
            "object_type": "product",
            "detailed": {
                "object_type": "product",
                "type": "A",
                "absolute_path": "/srv/projects/example.com/images/detailed/additional_image1.jpg", // Absolute filesystem path to the image
                "alt": "This is where the alt text for the image goes.",
            },
            {
            "object_type": "product",
            "detailed": {
                "object_type": "product",
                "type": "A",
                "alt": "This is where the alt text for the image goes.",
                "relative_path": "detailed/0/additional_image2.jpg" // Relative filesystem path to the image
            }
        },
    "main_pair": {
        "object_type": "product",
        "detailed": {
            "object_type": "product",
            "type": "M",
            "image_path": "https://example.com/images/detailed/main_image.jpg", // Valid URL pointing to the image
            "alt": "This is where the alt text for the image goes."
        }
    }
    }


This request creates a product with a price, the *Active* status, a main and 2 additional images. Images must be already uploaded on your server, or available somewhere on the Internet.
    
In this example we have uploaded 3 images:

* The main_image.jpg in the **main_pair** parameter is the main product image. It was uploaded from with the **image_path** parameter, which means it is added with a URL from the Internet.
* The additional_image1.jpg  is the additional image of a product. It was uploaded on the server via FTP. The path to the image is specified in the **absolute_path** parameter of the **detailed** object.
* The additional_image2.jpg is also an additional image, but it was uploaded in the Files section in the Admin panel. That's why it can be specified in the **relative_path** parameter.




---------------
Response Format
---------------

* The product has been created successfully: **HTTP/1.1 201 Created** and the JSON with the new ``product_id``::


    {
    "product_id": 391
    }



* The product couldn’t be created: **HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request**.

================
Update a Product
================ 

To update an existing product, send the PUT request to ``/api/products/<product_id>/``. For example::

    "product": "100g Pants Updated",
    "price": "31.00",
    "list_price": "35.00",
    "amount": "15"
    }

This request updates the Product Name, the List Price, the Price, and the Quantity of the particular Product.

    }


.. important::
    A product can have multiple images. You can specify them in the ``image_pairs`` object. It must come before the ``main_pair`` object with the main product image.
    
This request updates the Main image and the Additional image of the particular Product. It replaces the already existent images of the product with new ones. Images can be updated separately: for example, to update the additional image, you will need to specify the corresponding field - **image_pairs**. The image of the product can be uploaded on your server or added with URL. 
  
* To specify the image uploaded to your server, use the **absolute_path** parameter of the **detailed** object. 
* To specify the image hosted on another server, use the **image_url** parameter of the **detailed** object.
* To create a product with the main image, use the **main_pair** object.
* To add the additional image of the product, use the **image_pairs** object.


-----------------------------------------------
