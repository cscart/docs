****************************
Importing and Exporting Data
****************************

CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor support bulk data import and export in the **CSV** (comma-separated values) format. You can create and edit **.csv** files in a third-party application that supports this format, like Google Spreadsheets, LibreOffice Calc, Microsoft Office Excel, etc.

To import or export data, go to **Settings → Import data** or **Settings → Export data** respectively.

.. important::

    CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor can import only the files that use the `UTF-8 character set <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8>`_. If some values aren't imported properly (or at all), please try saving your file with the UTF-8 encoding and importing it again.
