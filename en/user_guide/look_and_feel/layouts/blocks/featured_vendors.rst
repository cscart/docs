Multi-Vendor allows you to add a special block to showcase your vendors and display their logos, addresses, and ratings.

Here's how to add this block:

#. Go to **Design → Layouts**.

#. Select the :doc:`layout page </user_guide/look_and_feel/layouts/layout_pages/index>` where you'd like to put that block (for example, *Homepage*).

#. Add a new block to the desired grid :doc:`as described in this article </user_guide/look_and_feel/layouts/blocks/actions_on_blocks>`.

#. When adding a block, switch to the **Create New Block** tab and choose *Vendors*.

#. Name the block as you see fit (for example, *Featured Vendors*).

#. Choose *Vendor logos and product count* as the **Template** for the block.

   .. hint:

       Click the **Settings** link to access the additional settings that will let you customize the look of the block.

#. Switch to the **Content** tab and choose the **Filling** of the block. You can either display *All* vendors, or *Manually* select what vendors should be there.

#. Switch to the **Block settings** tab and choose the number of vendors to be displayed in the block. If you don't want to limit the number of displayed vendors, set it to *0* (zero) or leave the field empty.

#. Click **Create**, and the block with vendors will appear.

.. hint::

    Once you create the block, open its settings again, and you'll be able to further change the appearance of the block by selecting a wrapper or specifying the block's CSS class.
