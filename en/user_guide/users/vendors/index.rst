===================================
Vendors and Vendor's Administrators
===================================

A vendor is an independent company with a separate administration panel. This panel can be accessed by the administrators associated with the vendor. These administrators are called **vendor's administrators**; they can fill the catalog with the vendor's products, manage the vendor's sales, orders, shipping methods, control personal earnings and payout balance.

To view the list of vendor's administrators, go to **Customers → Vendor's administrators**. This section works as described :doc:`in this document <../index>`.

If you are the root administrator, you can assign a **vendor's administrator** account to a vendor: 

* Go to **Customers → Vendor's administrators**.

* Click the name of the desired account. 

* Specify the associated vendor in **Vendor** select box. 

* Save your changes with the **Save** button.

.. important:: 
    For a vendor to be able to log in to the administration panel, there must be at least one vendor's administrator account associated with this vendor.
