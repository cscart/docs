Imported Fields Format
**********************

An imported CSV file with product information can contain the columns described below. We have :doc:`an example of the CSV file <import_example>` that you can check; you can also make an example yourself by :doc:`exporting products <product_export>`.

.. important::

    CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor can import only the files that use the `UTF-8 character set <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8>`_. If some values aren't imported properly (or at all), please try saving your file with the UTF-8 encoding and importing it again.

   :backlinks: none
   :local:

.. _import-product-code:

============
Product code 
============

This field is **mandatory**, and its value must be unique for each product. It can contain numbers, letters, or their combinations (up to 32 symbols). If you plan to :doc:`export product data to a CSV file <product_export>`, make sure that the CODE for each product is specified.

.. important::

    EXAMPLE: *B0002OG6NY*

.. warning::

    If the value of the field is equal to any existing product code, the imported data will replace the data of that product.

========
Language
========

A two-letter lowercase language code. This field is **mandatory**.

To find out a language code:

#. In the Administration panel, go to **Settings → Texts & Languages**.

#. Switch to the **Manage languages** tab.

#. Find the desired language and see it language code in the **Language code** row.

.. important::

    EXAMPLE: *en*

==========

.. important::

    EXAMPLE (the delimiter is *///*): *Computers///Desktops*

.. note::

    If the specified categories and subcategories don't exist in the database, they will be created.

If the name of your category contains a colon (``:``), for example *Promotions///Discount: 10%*, then you need to escape it like this in the imported file: ``|Promotions///Discount: 10%|``. Otherwise the category won't be imported correctly.

=====

===== 

The price of the product in your store. It must be in **0.00** format.

.. important::

    EXAMPLE: *1600.00*

* **Max quantity** is *10*. 

* **Quantity step** is *2*.

* **List qty count** is *3*.

Then customers will be able to choose between 2, 4, or 6 items of this product.

.. important::

    EXAMPLE: *10*

.. note::

    Using **List qty count** will turn the **Quantity** input field on the product page into a select box.

================
Shipping freight
================ 

The additional shipping cost for this particular product, which is specified in the primary currency of the store. The shipping freight is added to the shipping charges calculated at checkout; it can be used as packaging cost.

.. important::

    EXAMPLE: *2.00*

.. note::

    Assuming that the calculated shipping charges are $50, and the shipping freight of a product is $5, then having 3 items in the cart would make the total shipping cost $65.

The full path to the files of the downloadable product.

.. important::

    EXAMPLE: */home/client/public_html/cscart-4.4.1/var/files/exim/backup/downloads/filename.pdf*

The file can be specified without a path (just its name) if you specify **Files directory** when you :doc:`import a CSV file with product data <product_import>`. Several files must be delimited with a comma.

.. important::

    EXAMPLE: *file1.pdf, file2.jpg*

=================
Ship downloadable
=================

* **Y**—calculate the shipping cost for the downloadable product just like for a tangible one.

.. _advanced-image-import:

======
Images
======

.. note::

    This field is available only with the :doc:`/user_guide/addons/advanced_products_import/index` add-on.

The path (or paths) to product images. Multiple images can be specified by using the image delimiter in the additional settings on the **File** tab of an :doc:`import preset </user_guide/manage_products/import_export/advanced_product_import>`.

.. important::

    EXAMPLE: *exim/backup/images/main_image.jpg///exim/backup/images/additional_image.jpg*

The image file can be specified without a path (just its name) if you specify **Images directory** when you :doc:`import a CSV file with product data <product_import>`.

You can specify alternative text for images by adding it after the path.

.. important::

    EXAMPLE: *exim/backup/images/main_image.jpg#{[ar]:Arabic alt text;[en]:English alt text;}///exim/backup/images/Nadditional_image.jpg#{[ar]:Arabic alt text;[en]:English alt text;}*

If each product image has its own column (in a CSV file) or node (in an XML file), you can map all of them to **Images**. Then these fields will be combined properly, and multiple images will be imported for a product.


.. _csv-detailed-image-import:

==============
Detailed image
==============

The full path to the detailed product image.

.. important::

    EXAMPLE: */home/client/public_html/cscart/var/files/exim/backup/images/detailed_image.jpg*

The image file can be specified without a path (just its name) if you specify **Images directory** when you :doc:`import a CSV file with product data <product_import>`.

You can specify alternative text for images by adding it after the path. For example, to specify *ALT TEXT* as an alternative text for image in English and German, import the image as follows:

.. important::

    EXAMPLE: */home/client/public_html/cscart/var/files/exim/backup/images/detailed_image.jpg#{[de]:ALT TEXT;[en]:ALT TEXT;}*

=========
Thumbnail
=========

The full path to the product thumbnail image. **Thumbnails are generated from detailed images automatically**, so you need to use this field only if you want a thumbnail that is different from the detailed image of the product.

.. important::

    EXAMPLE: */home/client/public_html/cscart/var/files/exim/backup/images/thumbnail_image.jpg*

.. note::

    Specifying the paths and alternative text of the thumbnail works the same way as for :ref:`the detailed image <csv-detailed-image-import>`.

============
Product name
============

The name of the product, which can contain up to 255 symbols.

.. important::

    EXAMPLE: *Adidas Men's ClimaCool Short Sleeve Mock*

===========
Description
===========

The full description of the product, which can contain up to 16 777 215 symbols.

.. important::

    EXAMPLE: *ClimaCool is softer than cotton and resists pilling better than other natural and synthetic fibers. The shape and placement of ClimaCool fibers help move moisture quickly to the outer surface, where it evaporates away from the body.*

An imported file may contain HTML markup that affects the look of the text. It often occurs in the description, for example:

  <p><i>ClimaCool</i> is softer than cotton and resists pilling better than other natural and synthetic fibers.</p>

For CSV files it doesn't matter, but when you import an XML file, a problem occurs: XML and HTML tags both look like ``<...>``, and CS-Cart can't distinguish what is what. That's why HTML tags (a part of the description) must be separated from the XML tags (a part of the file structure). A text with HTML markup must be imported as follows:

  <![CDATA[<p><i>ClimaCool</i> is softer than cotton and resists pilling better than other natural and synthetic fibers.</p>]]>

=================
Short description
=================

The short description of the product, which can contain up to 16 777 215 symbols.

.. note::

    If a feature or its variant doesn't exist in the database, it will be created automatically. You can also :doc:`create features manually <../features/product_features>` or import them **before** you import products with those features.

.. _import-variation-group-code:

====================
Variation group code
====================

The common ID that ties multiple :doc:`product variations </user_guide/manage_products/products/product_variations>` into one group. For example, if you sell a T-shirt with features like *Size* and *Color*, then *medium white T-shirt* and *small blue T-shirt*  will be product variations. If their variation group code is the same, customers will be able to switch between these variations on the product page.

A group code can contain only digits, Latin characters, and the following signs: ``-`` and ``_``.

We have :doc:`a separate article on how to import product variations </user_guide/manage_products/import_export/variation_import>`.

.. important::

    EXAMPLE: *T-shirt_Need4Sports*

.. _import-variation-set-as-default:

========================
Variation set as default
========================

.. note::

    This column will work only if the imported file also includes *Variation group code*.

Multiple :doc:`product variations </user_guide/manage_products/products/product_variations>` can share one catalog item. In that case, customers will see only one of those variations in the product list on the storefront. Other variations will be selectable on the product page.

This column allows you to choose which variation customers will see first on the product list. It is not mandatory. Here is what happens if you don't include this column:

* When a variation group is created, then the first product in the group becomes a default variation.

* When products in an existing variation group are updated, the default variation won't change, regardless of the order of products in the imported file.

.. important::

    EXAMPLE: *Y*

.. _import-options:

=======

Variants can be specified for *select box* (*SG*) and *radio group* (*RG*) options right after the option type:

  *(Storefront) Option name: Option type[Variant 1///variant_property=value///variant_property=value, ..., Variant N///variant_property=value///variant_property=value]*

* **Variant 1, ..., Variant N**—the names of the variants. 

  .. important::

      EXAMPLE: *(Simtech) Color: SG[Red, Green, Blue]; (Simtech) Size: RG[S, M, L, XL, XXL]*

* **///**—the feature values delimiter that you specify when you :doc:`import a CSV file with product data <product_import>`.

    * **P**—a percentage.

    * **A**—a fixed value in the weight measurement unit of the store. 

  * **image**—an image of an option variant. This field works the same way as :ref:`the detailed image <csv-detailed-image-import>`.

.. important::

    EXAMPLE: *(Simtech) Size: SG[Normal,Large///modifier=10.000///modifier_type=P///weight_modifier=20.000///weight_modifier_type=A]; Color: SG[Grey///image=exim/backup/images/variant_image/grey_example.jpg,Black///modifier=50.000///modifier_type=A///image=exim/backup/images/variant_image/black_example.jpg]*

.. important::

    EXAMPLE (the delimiter is *///*): *Computers///New products; Computers///Desktops*

If the name of your category contains a colon (``:``), for example *Promotions///Discount: 10%*, then you need to escape it like this in the imported file: ``|Promotions///Discount: 10%|``. Otherwise the category won't be imported correctly.

When you have multiple secondary categories, it can look like this: ``Best Products;|Promotions///Discount: 10%|``.
