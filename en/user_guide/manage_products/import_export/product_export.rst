How To: Export Products and Product Data
****************************************

#. In the Administration panel, go to **Settings → Export data → Products**.

#. (optional) If you only want to export some specific products, then:

   * Click **Select** in the **Notes** section on the right. This will open the product list.

   * Select the products you'd like to export by clicking on them.

   * Choose **Export selected** in the **Actions** menu above the product list.

   * You'll be taken back to the **Export data** page, but this time only specific products will be selected for export.

#. Make sure that all the fields you want to export are in the **Exported fields**; move other fields to the **Available fields** box.
