How To: Set Up PayPal in CS-Cart
********************************

CS-Cart provides PayPal integrations to ensure a seamless and secure payment experience for both merchants and customers. We suggest using **PayPal Checkout** for your online store or **PayPal Commerce Platform** for your marketplace. 

There are two distinct PayPal integrations:

#. :doc:`PayPal Commerce Platform for marketplaces </user_guide/payment_methods/paypal_commerce_platform>`

.. note::
    
    If your marketplace uses the :doc:`Direct Customer-to-Vendor Payments </user_guide/addons/direct_customer_to_vendor_payments/index>` add-on, then you can also use PayPal Checkout.

PayPal Checkout for online stores
=================================

PayPal Checkout is most effective for online stores, as it follows the principal: one seller—one byuer, so there is only one transaction per order. Additionally, it provides the flexibility to customize the appearance of payment buttons. 


PayPal Checkout allows your customers to pay with the following payment methods:

* **PayPal, Pay Later, Venmo**
* **Credit** and **debit card** payments
* **Alternative payment methods**: iDEAL, Sofort, giropay, SEPA-Lastschrift, MyBank, Bancontact

**Pay Later** allows your customers to pay in convenient installments, while ensuring that you receive full payment at the checkout. Terms and conditions may vary from one country to another.

**Alternative payment methods** appear based on the customer's locations.


PayPal Commerce Platform for marketplaces
=========================================

Works best for marketplaces: it facilitates multiple transactions from one buyer to various sellers within single order. PayPal automatically splits the funds between the marketplace and the vendors whose products were purchased. The marketplace owner doesn’t have to transfer money manually.

PayPal Commerce Platform allows your customers to pay with the following payment methods:

* **Credit** or **debit cards**
* **PayPal Credit, Venmo**
* **Alternative payment methods**: SEPA-Lastschrift, Bancontact, eps, giropay, iDEAL, MyBank, Przelewy24, Sofort

It also allows to show various cards on checkout: Visa, Mastercard and other.
