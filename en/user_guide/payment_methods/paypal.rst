********************************

CS-Cart provides PayPal integrations to ensure a seamless and secure payment experience for both merchants and customers. We suggest using **PayPal Checkout** for your online store or **PayPal Commerce Platform** for your marketplace. 

There are two distinct PayPal integrations:

#. :doc:`How To: Set Up PayPal Checkout for Store Builder </user_guide/payment_methods/paypal_checkout>`: this article focuses on configuring PayPal Checkout in CS-Cart Store Builder. 
#. :doc:`How To: Set Up PayPal Commerce Platform for Marketplaces </user_guide/payment_methods/paypal_commerce_platform>`: for marketplace owners, this guide will help you set up the PayPal Commerce Platform for the CS-Cart Multi-Vendor platform.


.. note::
    If you are using :doc:`Direct Customer-to-Vendor Payments </user_guide/addons/direct_customer_to_vendor_payments/index>` add-on on your marketplace then you can also use PayPal Commerce Platform and allow your vendors create their own payment methods.
