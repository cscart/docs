How To: Set Up PayPal Checkout
******************************

.. note:: 
    
    Before you begin, make sure that the PayPal Checkout add-on is enabled. If not,  go to Add-ons – Downloaded Add-ons. Search for the PayPal Checkout add-on and enable it.

PayPal Checkout allows you to quickly set up a payment method in your online store and offer your customers secure and familiar payment options. Customers are required to have a PayPal account to checkout with this payment method, as their shipping and billing information is stored within their PayPal account. Because of this, they don’t have to re-enter their information on the checkout page, which makes their shopping secure and convenient.

#. Go to **Settings–>Payment methods**.
#. Click on the **+** icon to add a :doc:`new payment method </user_guide/payment_methods/adding_payment>`.
#. Create a new payment method based on the **PayPal Checkout** processor.
