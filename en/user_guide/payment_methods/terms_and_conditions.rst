How To: Add and Edit Terms and Conditions at Checkout
*****************************************************

CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor allow you to ask customers to agree with terms and conditions during the purchase of the product, at the checkout page. Here's how you can do it.

=============================================
Step 1. Add the Terms and Conditions Checkbox
=============================================

.. note::

    You'll probably skip this step: the checkbox for accepting terms and conditions exists at the checkout page by default.

#. Go to **Design → Layouts** and switch to the **Checkout** tab.

#. :doc:`Create a new block </user_guide/look_and_feel/layouts/blocks/actions_on_blocks>` of the **Checkout: Terms and Conditions** type.

#. Make sure to put this block it into the grid with the *Lite checkout* wrapper. It's where all the other checkout-related blocks are.

============================================
Step 2. Set the Text of Terms and Conditions
============================================

#. Go to **Administration → Languages → Translations**.

#. On that page, search for ``terms_and_conditions_content``.

#. Edit the values for the desired language and save your changes.
