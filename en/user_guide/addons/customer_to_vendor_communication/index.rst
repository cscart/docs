The **Message center** add-on helps to establish communication between CS-Cart users:

Functionality
=============

Communication with Customers
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The **Message center** add-on allows you and your vendors to stay in touch with customers. On the **Customers → Message center** page, vendors or marketplace owners can:

* read customers' messages;

* answer those messages, including customers' questions on specific products or orders. 

  The right side of the page contains the context (for example, information about the product or order), which allows you to understand the customer's question better. The link leads the vendor to the product page or order right from the dialogue.

The add-on allows customers to:

* ask a question right from the storefront via the **Ask a question** button.

* start communication from the order page via the **My Account → Orders** page.

* read and answer messages on the **Messages** tab in their accounts.

Communication between Vendors and Administrators
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The **Message center** add-on allows vendors and marketplace owners to communicate with each other on the **Vendors → Message center** page. This is useful in case if:

* the vendor has a question to the administrator;

* the admin has any comments or suggestions on how the product in the vendor's store should be filled, and he wants to show him what needs to be fixed;

* the marketplace owner wants to tell his vendors some important news.
