Google reCAPTCHA
****************

.. important::

    Starting with version 4.5.1, Google reCAPTCHA is the only default anti-bot protection mechanism. The old CAPTCHA was removed.
    
The **Google reCAPTCHA** add-on provides anti-bot protection without making it complicated for humans to navigate and use the store.

The add-on supports two reCAPTCHA versions:

* *reCAPTCHA v2: Checkbox* uses physical verification in the form of tests. In most cases, your customers simply have to tick the "I'm not a robot" checkbox to confirm that they're humans. If the algorithm has reasons to supspect that a customer is a bot, then the customer will be asked to solve a CAPTCHA.

* *reCAPTCHA v3* is invisible for customers and protects your store by working in the background. The add-on supports *reCAPTCHA v3* starting with version 4.12.1 of CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor.
