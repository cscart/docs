Introduction to the Administration Panel
****************************************

The **Administration Panel** (or the admin panel for short) is the primary tool for you to work with your online store. Here you can manage products and orders, offer discounts, interact with your customers, change the look of your store and do much more.

The admin panel is responsive: it adapts to the screen size of the device you view it from. That way, you can manage your store from mobile devices.

===========================
Connect to Your Admin Panel
===========================

To find the admin panel, open your online store’s website with a browser and add */admin.php* to the end of the URL.

.. important::

    If you already :doc:`installed CS-Cart <../install/index>` and :doc:`renamed admin.php <../install/security>` for security reasons, use the URL of your shop and **the new name of the admin.php file**, for example:

    *mynewshop.tk/my_admin_panel.php* 

For example, let's log in to the admin panel of the CS-Cart Online Demo (`demo.cs-cart.com <http://demo.cs-cart.com/>`_). Navigate to: `demo.cs-cart.com/admin.php <http://demo.cs-cart.com/admin.php>`_

Enter the administrator’s *email* and *password* that you used during CS-Cart installation. In CS-Cart Online Demo the email and password are already there for you, so all you have to do is click the **Sign in** button.

The Dashboard
=============

The first thing you’ll notice is the **Dashboard**, where you can check sales statistics, view recent orders and product changes. The Dashboard also provides information from the database, such as the number of active products and registered customers.

=============
Growth center
=============

The **Growth center** button located in the upper right corner is a way to get acquainted with your CS-Cart store. This tool is very useful for begginers, who may find it difficult to find relevant information that they need to start selling. When you open the Growth Center on any page in the store, such as Products, Orders, Vendors, or any other page, it will provide corresponding articles in documentation, videos, add-ons and other resources.
