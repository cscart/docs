Overview
--------

    The **Google AMP** add-on allows to create mobile optimized content for the product details pages of your store.

    **AMP** stands for **Accelerated Mobile Pages**, a Google project, which aims to build web pages that are lightweight and speedy to load, particularly on mobile devices.

    Your customers will see a simplified layout on product pages:
