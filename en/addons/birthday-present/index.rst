============
How it works
============

    Customers register in the store and add their date of birth in the profile. Change of date of birth can be limited in admin panel.

    The administrator creates a cart promotion with the Birthday condition and adds bonuses, for example, a discount, a gift certificate, or a free product.

    On the specified date, the customer gets an email notification with birthday wishes and a personal bonus.

Setting up the add-on
=====================

    Here are available settings of the Birthday Present add-on:

    .. fancybox:: img/Birthday-present-002.png
        :alt: Birthday Present add-on settings

    * **The number of days before the birthday**—Defines how many days prior to the birthday the promotion should start.

    * **The number of days after the birthday**—Defines how many days after the birthday the promotion should be valid (including the birthday)

    * **Sending warning letters to e-mail for a specified number of days**—Specifies the number of days within which the user will get notifications about their approaching birthday.

    You can set up a cron job to run it according to a schedule to send email notifications. For example, if you enter **2** in the previous setting, the script will check all the users for the date of their birth and send an email notification to users whose birthday is in two days. 

    *php /path/to/cart/admin.php –dispatch=seo_pack_cron.apply –cron_password=CRON_PASSWORD*, where:

    **path/to/cart** is the path to your website.

    **CRON_PASSWORD** is the access key to cron script that you can find under **Settings > Security settings** in the admin panel.
