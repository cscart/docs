Overview
--------

    Let your customers easily scroll to the top of your website with a smart **Back to Top**. 

    When a user has sufficiently scrolled down the page, this helpful button appears that brings your shoppers back to the top of the page with a smooth scrolling animation. 

    It’s an especially useful feature if you are showing a lot of products on product and category pages. It will save time and free your customers from the need for vertical scrolling with the mouse.
