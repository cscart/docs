        :alt: Social Proof add-on

    * **Active**—Enables the *Purchased X times in the last 24 hours* message on the product page. The number of purchases will be counted for the last 24 hours.
    
    * **Use fake data**—If enabled, the system will use untrue data created by cron to show numbers in real-time stats. The number of purchases will be a random value between the **Minimum purchase count with fake enabled** value and **Maximum purchase count with fake enabled** value.

    * **Count purchases**—Select the period of time within which the number of purchased products will be counted. Available values are: per day/per week/per month/for all time/

    .. fancybox:: img/sales-and-social-proof-category-page-1.png
        :alt: Social Proof add-on

    * **Show if product is out of stock**—If enabled, the number of times the product was purchased will be shown even if the product is out of stock. Clear the checkbox if you do not want to show this information when the product is out of stock.

    * **Display probability**—Define how frequent the message should be displayed. Enter the value from 0 to 100 in percentage. The lower the number, the less likely the message is to be shown. Probability of 100 means that the message will be shown all the time. Probability of 50 means that the message is half as likely to be shown.

    * **Minimum purchase count with fake enabled**—If you use fake data generated by cron, enter the minimum possible number of purchased products to display. The system will randomly pick a number between this value and the value from the field below to show in the message. For example, if you enter *20* here and *25* in the field below, the number of purchased products will be a random number between 20 and 25.

    * **Maximum purchase count with fake enabled**—If you use fake data generated by cron, enter the maximum possible number of purchased products to display. The system will randomly pick a number between the value above and this value to show in the message.

    .. image:: img/message-a.png

    * **Count views**—Define the time period within which the number of product views will be calculated.

    * **Display probability**—Define how frequent the message should be displayed. Enter the value from 0 to 100 in percentage. The lower the number, the less likely the message is to be shown. Probability of 100 means that the message will be shown all the time. Probability of 50 means that the message is half as likely to be shown.

    * **Minimum online users with fake enabled**—If you use fake data generated by cron, enter the minimum number of online users to display. The system will randomly pick a number between this value and the value from the field below to show in the message. For example, if you enter *10* here and *15* in the field below, the number of users looking at this product will be a random number between 10 and 15.

    * **Maximum online users with fake enabled**—If you use fake data generated by cron, enter the maximum number of online users to display.

      If you enter 3 and the product quantity is 4 (higher than the value defined), 2 options are possible:
    
        - the message will not be shown if real data is used;
        
        - the message will contain the random value of 1-3 if fake data is used.

    * **Display probability**—Define how frequent the message should be displayed. Enter the value from 0 to 100 in percentage. The lower the number, the less likely the message is to be shown. Probability of 100 means that the message will be shown all the time. Probability of 50 means that the message is half as likely to be shown.

    * **Display probability if fake data enabled**—Define how frequent the message containing fake data should be displayed. Enter the value from 0 to 100 in percentage like in the setting above. This value will be used in case the product in-stock quantity is higher than the Quantity value defined above.
