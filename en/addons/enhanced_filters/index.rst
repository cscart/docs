FAQ
===

	* *I had changed the filter type in settings, however the filter template was changed on the storefront.*

	 You need open **Administration -> Storage -> Clear cache**. CS-Cart software saves the cache for previous templates in order to optomize a website perfomance. 

	* *How will the Vendor Locations filters be displayed?* 

	 The dispplay of the Vendor Locations filters is related to the theme settings. An example of the defalut display you can find `here <https://docs.cs-cart.com/latest/user_guide/addons/vendor_locations/index.html?>`_.
