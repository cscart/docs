    With the `Points and Bonuses add-on <https://www.simtechdev.com/addons/marketing/points-and-cash.html>`_, you can get the most out of your points-based loyalty campaign by allowing your customers to enjoy the freedom of mixing cash and points—from a single product to a whole shopping cart.

    You can give your customers reward points for registration and leaving product reviews. Points for registration are granted automatically right after registration is complete. Points for reviews are granted once the administrator approves the review. Customers can see the amount of points they have in their profile.

    The add-on lets you disable using reward points for products and carts with applied promotions and set the percentage of the product price that can be paid with reward points.

Managing comments and reviews
=============================

    The add-on enables you to give customers reward points for leaving comments and reviews for products. We advise you to re-check settings of the **Comments and reviews** add-on. Check whether the administrator needs to approve posts submitted by customers. If approval required, customers will get reward points for the submitted review only after the administrator approves it. If no approval needed, reward points will be given automatically.

            :alt: Import order bonuses

    * **Overwrite bonuses users at import**—User bonus points will be updated during import. If the setting is not active, the bonuses will be summarized, i.e. the imported bonus points will be added to the user's existing points. If the setting is active, the user's bonus points will be updated by the number of points from the imported file.

    * **Accrue bonuses users at order import**—Award bonus points to the user for the imported order. If the setting is not active, points will be displayed only in the order details, i.e. the bonus points information will be imported only in the order details. If the setting is active, bonus points for the imported order will be added to the user's existing points.

    * **Write off bonuses used by users when importing orders**—Write off bonus points in use from users for the imported order. If the setting is active, the points in use will be write off from the user's account, i.e. the points in use from the imported order will be write off from the user's current account. If the setting is not active, the information about bonus points in use will be displayed only in the order details.

=============
Adding a hook
=============

    .. important::

        If your CS-Cart or Multivendor store runs on version lower than 4.3.1, you'll need to insert a hook to make the add-on perform correctly. 

    To do this, please follow the steps below:

    1. Open the app/addons/reward_points/func.php file of your CS-Cart installation.

    2. Approximately on line 259, right after this:

    .. code::

        if (defined('ORDER_MANAGEMENT')) {
        $user_points = fn_get_user_additional_data(POINTS, $auth['user_id']) + (!empty($cart['previous_points_info']['in_use']['points']) ? $cart['previous_points_info']['in_use']['points'] : 0);
        } else {
        $user_points = !empty($user_info) ? $user_info['points'] : 0;
        }

    insert this line:

    .. code::

        fn_set_hook('set_point_payment', $cart, $cart_products, $auth, $user_info, $cost_covered_by_applied_points, $point_exchange_rate, $user_points);

    3. Approximately on line 549, right after this:

    .. code::

        function fn_gather_reward_points_data(&$product, &$auth, $get_point_info = true)
        {

    insert this line:

    .. code::

        fn_set_hook('gather_reward_points_data_pre', $product, $auth, $get_point_info);

    Save the changes.
