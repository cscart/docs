Overview
--------

    The `Push Notifications <https://www.simtechdev.com/addons/site-management/push-notifications.html>`_ add-on integrates the `Pusher <https://pusher.com/>`_ service with your CS-Cart store, enabling you to alert administrators about valuable information in real time, such as a new order placement or a new review submitted.
    
    A push notification will pop up in the top right corner and stay there until the administrator closes it or goes to another page in the admin panel.

    Another useful feature of the add-on is that it shows you which of your administrators are currently viewing this or that page in the admin panel.

    .. fancybox:: img/Push_notifications_015.png

    Clicking on the particular administrator will open its detailed page.

    Thus, you will see the number of administrators on the following pages:

    - product editing page

    - order details page

    - user details page

    - category editing page

How it works

    **Case 1. New order notification.**

    Customer Karl places an order in your store.

    The administrator gets a push notification of the newly placed order right away:

    Clicking on the link in the notification opens the order details page:
