Overview
--------

    **The FB Pixel** is a useful tool for your website that enables you to measure, optimize and build audiences for your ad campaigns. Using the FB Pixel, you can track the actions people take on your website across devices to run Facebook advertising campaigns more effectively. 

    The FB Pixel add-on integrates the service with your store, giving you the ability to:

    - view statistics of your store (page views, adding to cart, purchases, adding to wish list, one click buy, request a call, etc.)

    - create ad campaigns for Facebook and Instagram

    - measure cross-device conversions (see how your customers are moving between devices before they convert)

    - create Custom Audiences for people who take specific actions on your website, like visited a product page, added to cart or purchased a product.

Creating a Facebook pixel
=========================

    1. Go to `The Facebook pixel <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel>`_.
    
    2. Click **Get the Pixel**.
    
    3. Enter a name for your pixel. There's only one pixel per ad account, so choose a name that represents your business.
    
    4. Click **Create Pixel**.
    
    If you work on your website yourself, click **Install Pixel Now**.
    
    If someone else works on your website, click **Email Pixel Code**. Type in that person's email address and click **Send**.
   
    Keep in mind there is only one Facebook pixel per account. However, you can add standard events or custom conversions to your pixel to report different conversion events.

    Once you create a pixel, you will get a Pixel ID that you should specify in the settings of the add-on.

Event statistics
================

    The Facebook Pixel event statistics page can be found in `the Ads Manager <https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager/pixel/facebook_pixel>`_.

    The Facebook Pixel page gives you insight into the traffic on your website. It tells you what pages people are looking at, on which devices they're viewing your website, and what actions they're taking (e.g. purchases). Below, we'll explain each element of the Facebook Pixel page:

    .. fancybox:: img/Selection_04.png
        :alt: Facebook Ads Manager

    **Time frame** - you can select the time frame of your data.

    **Total traffic** - see how much traffic there's been on your website. A dotted line means the data isn't filled for that day yet. Keep in mind this counts raw pixel fires (every time your page loads), which is different from browser sessions.

    **Pixel status** - make sure your Pixel status is set to the Active status.

    **Data filters** - click these buttons to break down your data by URL, Domain, Device or Event.
