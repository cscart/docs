Overview

    Keep your accounts safe with two-factor authentication by `Duo <https://duo.com/>`_.

    Our `Auth by Duo <https://www.simtechdev.com/addons/site-management/two-factor-authentication-by-duo.html>`_ add-on integrates the service with your CS-Cart store to protect your users against credential theft attacks.

==================================
What is two-factor authentication?
==================================

    Two-factor authentication (2FA) strengthens access security by requiring two methods to verify your identity: by something you know (like a username and password) and something you have (like a smartphone or smartwatch).

    It is the most effective way to protect your store against remote attacks such as phishing, credential exploitation and other attempts to take over your account.

============
How it works
============

    Sign in to the store like you normally do by entering your username and password.

    Then you'll be suggested to select one of the methods for the second step of authentication. 

    Let's select **Push notification**.
