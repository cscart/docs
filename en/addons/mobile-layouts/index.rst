Overview
--------

    **The Mobile Layouts add-on** is a super useful extension that allows you to show different layouts on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices. Unlike desktop versions, mobile screens can fit less blocks, so it may come in handy to customize the layout for each device to ensure your visitors get the best viewing experience no matter what device they use.

    Often, a site designed for desktop has larger images and more information (images, banners, blocks, etc.). On mobile phones the page layouts are overwhelming when showing all the content that a user interacts with from the full-site. Besides, if you display all of the desktop content on a small device, it can become difficult for visitors to navigate. A desktop site may also contain additional information that might not be applicable to visitors using a mobile device.

    This being said, the importance of creating mobile-friendly page layouts becomes obvious.

=================
Creating a layout
=================

    To create a new mobile layout for a phone or tablet, first of all you'll need to review the content on the existing site and determine which items are essential for the mobile device user experience. Keeping in mind that smartphone / tablet visitors are often on the go and are viewing the content on a smaller screen, it is important to simplify the design and only display content that is useful and easy to interact with on a touch screen.

    To manage layouts, navigate to **Design - Layouts**.

    Click the **+** button in the top right to create a new layout.

    Enter all the necessary information and click **Create**.

    You can now set up the layout up to your needs by changing the position of blocks, resizing or removing blocks, and so on.

How do I add different logos for different layouts?
===================================================

    If you want to add different logos for different layouts, do so by going to **Design -> Themes**.

    Choose the layout you want to change the logo for and click **Theme editor**.

    .. fancybox:: img/Layouts_for_devices_006.png

    Choose **Logos** to customize and click **Save**.

    .. fancybox:: img/Layouts_for_devices_007.png
        :alt: Theme editor

    Once you've clicked **Save** the style you are editing will be cloned as you can not modify the existing style right away. You will be asked to enter a name for the style:

    .. fancybox:: img/Layouts_for_devices_008.png
        :alt: name for style
        :width: 350px

    After that you can upload a new logo by clicking **Browse**.

    .. fancybox:: img/Layouts_for_devices_009.png
        :alt: Theme editor
        :width: 200px

    The logo will appear in the layout.
