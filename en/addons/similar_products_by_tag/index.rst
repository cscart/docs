===============
Creating blocks
===============

    In order to display similar products on the product page, let's add a block.

    Go to **Design - Layouts** and open **Products** tab. Locate the **Main Content** block and click the + button to add a new block. 

    .. fancybox:: img/Selection_02.png
        :alt: creating new block
        :width: 650px

    In the opened pop-up window, open the **Create new block** tab and select **Products**.

    .. fancybox:: img/Selection_03.png
        :alt: creating new block products
        :width: 650px

    In the **General tab** enter the name of the block and select the template type you like.

    .. fancybox:: img/Selection_04.png
        :alt: creating new block. general tab
        :width: 650px

    In the **Content** tab set **Filling** to Tags, specify the number of products you want to display per page in the **Limit** field and click **Create**.

    .. fancybox:: img/Selection_05.png
        :alt: creating new block. content tab
        :width: 650px

    You should see the created block on the editing layout page.

    .. fancybox:: img/Selection_06.png
        :alt: created block
        :width: 650px

    You can also add a block with products by tag to a page, if necessary. For example, you have a page containing an article about cotton clothing. So, you add the 'cotton' tag both to the page and cotton products from your store and these products will be displayed in a block on the corresponding page. 

    Go to the **Pages** tab on the same page, locate the **Main Content** block and click the + button to add a new block.

    .. fancybox:: img/Selection_07.png

        :width: 650px

    In the opened pop-up, select the previously created block or create a new one.

===========
Adding tags
===========

    In order to add tags to products, go to **Products - Products**, select the desired product and open the **Tags** tab. Enter tags to the **Tags** field, by clicking Enter each time you add a new tag.

    When you specify the same tags for products, they will be displayed as similar products for each other.

Bulk tag editing
================

    There are two ways of how you can add or edit tags of multiple products at once.

    * Bulk editing

    1. In the admin panel, go to **Products - Products**.

    2. Select the checkboxes next to products you want to edit. For example, I am going to add tags for LED TV sets in my store. So I search for *LED* and select all the found products.

    5. Enter tags and click **Save**.

    * Product export/import 

    1. In the admin panel, go to **Administration - Export data - Products**.

    2. Find **Tags** in the Available fields and move it to the Exported fields.

    3. Click the **Export** button in the top right.

    4. Specify tags for products in the exported csv file.

    5. Once all the necessary tags are specified, you need to import products. Go to **Administration - Import data - Products**.

    6. Select the import file and click **Import**.
