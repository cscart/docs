Overview
--------

    **The Auto Address add-on** adds an autocomplete text field to help your customers quickly fill in the shipping and billing address at checkout. 

    As the user enters text, autocomplete returns place predictions in the form of a dropdown pick list. When the user selects a place from the pick list, autocomplete will fill in the rest:

    If you run a multi-vendor store, a useful feature for your vendors will be address autocomplete in the vendor registration form.
