Sending an attachment by email
==============================

    The Advanced Orders add-on also allows you to send attachments and invoices to customers by email automatically when the order status is changed to a specific one.

    First, navigate to **Administration - Order statuses** and select a desired status.

     .. fancybox:: img/Order_Improvements_Selection_012.png
        :alt: order statuses

    Select the **Send attachments by e-mail** checkbox to send a specific attachment and/or **Send invoice by e-mail** to send an invoice:

    .. fancybox:: img/Order_Improvements_Selection_013.png
        :alt: Send attachments and invoice by e-mail

    Then add an attachment under **Orders - Attachments**:

    .. fancybox:: img/Order_Improvements_Selection_014.png
        :alt: changing order status

    Specify the necessary information in the pop-up:

    .. fancybox:: img/Order_Improvements_Selection_015.png
        :alt: changing order status

    Or you can add an attachment to a specific order (see the `Adding attachments to the order`_ section).

    So once the order status is changed, a notification will be sent to the customer:

    .. fancybox:: img/Order_Improvements_Selection_010.png
        :alt: changing order status

    and the attached files will be sent automatically.
