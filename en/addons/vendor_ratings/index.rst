Overview
--------

    The **Vendor Ratings** add-on is a powerful tool that will measure the customer experience your sellers provide. It is a great way to speak for vendor performance, ranking and the services your vendors offer.

    The power of ratings should not be underestimated. Customers coming online to shop greatly value ratings and their buying decision is, more often than not, based on them. Each seller should strive for good ratings and reviews as higher rating will bring more sales.

    The rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. Over time, vendors develop a reputation, based on other people's comments and ratings.

    Customers can rate a vendor by clicking the **Rate vendor** button and filling in the form:

    * **Send email notifications to**—Enter an email address of the person who should be notified of negative reviews.

    * **Negative rating up to**—The maximum number of stars that is considered to be a negative review. Say, you consider 2 or less stars as a negative rating, then if a customer gives you 1 or 2 star(s), a notification will be sent to the email address defined in the setting above.

    The following three settings will allow you to select the position of the vendor rating on the product details page:

    * **Show rating next to vendor's name**—Show vendor rating next to vendor's name.

    You will also need to make some adjustments in the standard **Comments and reviews** add-on.

    .. fancybox:: img/Vendor_ratings_011.png
        :alt: settings of Vendor Ratings add-on

    In the **Reviews** select-box select either *Rating* or *Communication and rating*.

    In the former case customers will be able to give you a rating only:

    .. fancybox:: img/Vendor_ratings_012.png

        :width: 589px

    In the latter case customers will be able to give you a rating and write a review:

    .. fancybox:: img/Vendor_ratings_006.png
        :alt: settings of Vendor Ratings add-on
        :width: 583px

    If you require approving reviews submitted by customers, choose whose comments should be approved.:

    Specify the rest of the settings up to your liking.

=================

    To approve a review submitted by customers, navigate to **Website - Comments and reviews** in the **Company Reviews** tab.

    Click the **thumbs-up button** under the post you want to approve and click **Save**.

    Only after you approve a review, it will be taken into account in the vendor rating.

============================================
Adding a block with rating to a vendor store
============================================

    To display a vendor's rating in his/her store, add a **Vendor rating block** to the Vendor store layout.
