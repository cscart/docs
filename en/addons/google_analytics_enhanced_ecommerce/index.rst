=====================
Installing the add-on
=====================

    Install the “GA Pro” add-on on the add-ons list page (“Add-ons” → ”Manage add-ons”). Click the + button in the top right corner, select an archive and click Upload & install. You can now find the installed add-on in the list of installed add-ons, just make sure it is set to Active.

==================
Available settings
==================

    To set up the add-on, configure the following settings:

+++++++
General
+++++++

    .. fancybox:: img/Google_analytics_settings_1.png
        :alt: setting up the add-on

    * **Google Analytics account number**—Enter your Tracking ID that you can find under Admin -> Property settings -> Tracking ID.

    .. fancybox:: img/Google_analytics_018.png
        :alt: Google Analytics Tracking ID

    * **Use as product ID**—Define the parameter that will be used as the product identifier in Google Analytics: unique product ID from CS-Cart or its code (SKU). If you use products with options, the code of the corresponding option combination will be used as the unique identifier. If the code is not defined for the option combination, the code of the main store will be used.

    * **Notify visitors about User-ID Google Analytics function use**—Check this box if you want to notify your customers that the User-ID function is used on the site. In this case a warning will be displayed when they enter the store:

    .. fancybox:: img/Google_analytics_021.png
        :alt: User-ID Google Analytics function

    * **IP anonymizer**—If the setting is enabled, the user's IP address will be hidden in Google Analytics. Read for `more details <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en>`_.

    * **Allow vendors to track page views**—Allow vendors to track quantity of page views using their Google Analytics accounts. See `Additional settings for vendors`_ for more details.

++++++++++++++++++++++
Non-interactive events
++++++++++++++++++++++

    Enabling/Disabling non-interactive events helps you control the bounce rate. It allows you to determine how you want bounce rate defined for pages on your site that also include tracking of events, like "product quick view", "add to comparsion list", "add to wishlist", and "buy with one click". In other words, you can decide whether to consider sessions including only these events to be calculated as bounces or not.

    Select the checkboxes of events that should not be calculated as bounces.

    .. fancybox:: img/Google_analytics_settings_2.png
        :alt: setting up the add-on

    .. note::

        **Bounce rate** is the percentage of visitors who come to your website and leave without viewing any other pages on your website. In other words, a user comes to a single page on your website and then exits without performing any actions, like product view, banner click, addition to cart, etc. 

        By default, the following events are excluded from bounce rate calculation:

        - add to cart
        - remove from cart
        - call request

        The event that is calculated as bounces by default is viewing products in blocks. It concerns the products displayed in the blocks, like "Hot deals", "Sale", "Similar products", "At the same price", etc. It means that if the customer visits a store page with such blocks and leaves right away, the bounce rate will be calculated. The product views can still be tracked in the Google Analytics account under Conversions > Ecommerce > Product List Perfomance.

    For more information on non-interactive events, refer to `this article <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033068?hl=en#NonInteractionEvents>`_.

===============================
Additional settings for vendors
===============================

    If you allow vendors to see statistics in Google Analytics, vendors will need to make some additional adjustments:

    1. Go to the account settings.

    2. Switch to the **Add-ons** tab.

    3. Enter tracking ID in the **Google Analytics account number”** field.

    .. fancybox:: img/Google_analytics_026.png
        :alt: Google Analytics for vendors

    Note that each vendor will be able to track events related to their own orders and products in their Google Analytics account. For example, if the user adds a product from Vendor 1 to cart, only Vendor 1 and the root admin will see this event. If the user places an order with products from Vendor 1 and Vendor 2, the root admin will see statistics with products from both Vendor 1 and Vendor 2. In this case Vendor 1 will see statistics only with his products and Vendor 2 will see statistics with his.

    Vendors can also be allowed to track the page visits by selecting the relative option in the vendor rate tab:

    1. Open vendor plan editing tab (vendors->Vendor Plan)

    2. Select the 'Allow vendors to track the page views' option on the Add-ons tab

    3. Open the settings of the vendor that uses the relevent plan (or change the present plan)

    4. Insert the valid analytic number into the 'Google Analytics account number' field of the Add-ons tab

    After the settings above are complete the page views data will be displayed by 'Google Analytics Debugger' extension in the browser console.
