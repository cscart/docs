    Installation of the add-on requires advanced technical skills. It is created mainly for developers to use in further development.

--------
Overview
--------

    The **IP Geolocation** add-on is a professional solution that adds the ability to determine the user's location by IP address using the `MaxMind <https://www.maxmind.com>`_ databases. 

    MaxMind offers free and paid databases with the most up-to-date and accurate data available. 

    The advantages of the add-on are the following:

    1. Geolocation is determined at the server level without involving web browsers, which allows to offer content taking into account customer's location at their first visit.

    2. Geodata is determined very quickly by local databases, it does not depend on external services.

    3. Extended data for multiple languages (country, region, city).

    IP Geolocation adds the following functionality:

    The customer's city will be determined and displayed in the header of the storefront.

    If the city is not determined, this pop-up will be displayed:

    .. fancybox:: img/Maxmind_popup.png
        :alt: city by IP
        :width: 650px

    After clicking *Select city*, a customer will be able to specify the city manually.

    .. fancybox:: img/Maxmind_Selection_011.png

    The country, region, city fields are auto-completed at checkout.

        :width: 650px

    The store currency will be automatically set to the customer's currency depending on their country.

    Follow the instructions to download the database archives from `the MaxMind website <http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/#Databases>`_ and unpack them in the right directory. You should download these two archives:

        :width: 650px

    * CSV file

    Note that you should take the CSV file that corresponds to the language used in your store from the downloaded archive. For example, for the English language it's the GeoLite2-City-Locations-en.csv file.

    .. fancybox:: img/Maxmind_Selection_04.png
