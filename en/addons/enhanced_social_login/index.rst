Presets

    Make sure the default **Social login** add-on is set to Active in your store. Otherwise the Social Auth add-on will not work correctly.

    To let your customers sign up with **Google, Facebook, Yahoo**, or other networks, you need to create corresponding social network providers in your store under **Website → Social login**.
