Overview
--------

    The `Hide Payments <https://www.simtechdev.com/addons/site-management/hide-payment-and-shipping-methods-for-user-groups.html>`_ add-on is the best way to make sure the right customers see the right payment or shipping options in your store. It allows you to hide any payment or shipping method from a particular user group.

=========================================
Why standard functionality is not enough?
=========================================

    Say, you want the **Credit card** payment method to be available to your retail customers and hide it from wholesale customers. So you try to set this up in the payment method settings:

    .. fancybox:: img/Hide_payment_and_shipping_010.png
        :alt: Hide Payments

    But you face with the problem that both retail and wholesale customers are associated with the registered users. So, you cannot allow your retail customers who have registered in the store to use the credit card option without also allowing the wholesale group to do so. It's kind of a dilemma, huh?

========================
What does the add-on do?
========================

    The main idea of the add-on is to allow you to show/hide any payment or shipping method from any user group. So, there is no more confusion with user groups. The above issue can be easily solved by adjusting the settings in the following way:
