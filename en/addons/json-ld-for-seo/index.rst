Overview
--------

    Add a great boost to your SEO with our **JSON-LD** add-on. JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) offers a simpler means to create machine-readable data from websites to promote search results. Basically, the add-on adds ``schema.org`` data to your website to improve the search ranking.

    Schema is not simple to put on a website, but thanks to our add-on, all you need to do is to fill the fields in with the corresponding information, and the rest is covered with our add-on. No advanced settings, no coding, no effort!

Advantages of the JSON-LD add-on over the standard functionality
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The add-on overrides the JSON data added by the default SEO add-on, adds additional types of properties and functions. 

    .. fancybox:: img/json-03.png
        :alt: differences of add-ons

    ``*`` You can set up some points according to your needs in the add-on settings (brand, gtin, logo, etc.)

    Here is the example of the validation of the page with the default schema markup added:

    .. fancybox:: img/json-04.png
        :alt: page without JSON-LD

    The schema is only on the product page and comprises one element: Product.

    And here is the page with the JSON-LD add-on enabled:

        :alt: page with JSON-LD

    .. fancybox:: img/NewTags.png
        :alt: page with JSON-LD


    There are 4 elements: Organization, Breadcrumbs, WebSite, and Product.

How to fix common validation errors
-----------------------------------

    ``The aggregateRating field is recommended.``

    Try checking if the ratings on products are filled.

    ``The review field is recommended.``

    Check if product reviews are filled. Use the default CS-Cart `Comments and reviews add-on <https://docs.cs-cart.com/latest/user_guide/addons/comments_and_reviews/index.html>`_ to collect reviews and ratings.

    ``The sku field is recommended.``

    Check if sku (code) is filled for the product.

    ``The brand field is recommended.``

    Check if the standard `brand field <https://docs.cs-cart.com/latest/user_guide/manage_products/features/manufacturer.html>`_ on the product is filled and the corresponding feature is specified in the add-on settings on the `Products`_ tab.

    ``The gtin/mpn/isbn is missing.``

    Create a new feature for some global identifier and fill it in for your products. After creating a feature, select this feature in the Global identifier value setting in the add-on settings on the `Products`_ tab and specify in the Global identifier name field the name of the chosen global identifier.

    ``The priceValidUntil field is missing.``

    Fill in the Price Valid field in the add-on settings on the `Products`_ tab.
