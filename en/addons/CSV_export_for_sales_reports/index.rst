Overview
--------

    A sales report is a useful tool to help store administrators analyze their business performance. Therefore, CS-Cart provides many sales report types for them.

    Our `CSV Export <https://www.simtechdev.com/addons/site-management/sales-reports-csv-export.html>`_ add-on helps you export sales reports in one click.

    The add-on creates an **Export report** button on the sales reports page. Click the button to export data to a CSV file.

    It can then be opened in Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc.
