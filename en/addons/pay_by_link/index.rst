Overview
--------

    With the Pay by Link add-on, you can easily create payment links and deliver them directly to your customers' inbox. All you need is to create an order, copy the order’s link in your admin panel, and send it automatically with an invitation letter containing a link to view and pay the order. The `Pay by Link add-on <https://www.simtechdev.com/addons/customer-experience/pay-by-link.html>`_ provides you with new abilities:

    * create payment links for orders;
    * send a customer an invitation to view the order details;
    * send a customer an invitation to pay the order (for some payment methods);
    * avoid customer's mistakes in orders;
    * improve cash-flow by giving your customer a quick way to pay;
    * enhance customer experience with a 'pay the order' or'view the order' button in emails.

=====================
Setting up the add-on
=====================

     .. fancybox:: img/Pay-by-link_01.png
        :alt: add-on settings
 
    * **License key**—Enter the license key to activate the add-on. You will receive this key in the order confirmation email. You can also see license keys for all your purchased add-ons in your HelpDesk account. 

    * **Use a SEO link**—Use the short format of links. Compare the long format: ``your_domain/index.php?dispatch=pay_by_link_invitation.pay_order&invitation_id=x`` with the short one: ``your_domain/pay-by-link/x``.

    * **SEO parameter for order view**—Specify the parameter in the SEO link for **Link to view**. The value should be entered without spaces. For example, if you add ``v`` in that field, the link will look like this:``your_domain/v/xxx``. The **Use a SEO link** setting should be enabled.

    * **SEO parameter for order payment**—Specify the parameter in the SEO link for **Link to pay**. The value should be entered without spaces. For example, if you add ``p`` in that field, the link will look like this:``your_domain/p/xxx``. The **Use a SEO link** setting should be enabled.

    * **Use the link for payment**—Create a direct link to the payment gateway to pay for the order. Note that **Link to pay** is **not available** for all payment methods.

    * **Do not create links automatically**—Links to orders will not be created automatically.

    * **Pay incompleted order again**—Allows paying the order again by the link with the **Incomplete** status. Clicking the link will change the order status to **Open**.

========================
Additional configuration
========================

    Decide for which order statuses you want to let customers pay orders by link and enable the **Pay order again** option for them (Administration > Order statuses).

        .. fancybox:: img/Pay-by-link_012.png
            :alt: order status
        
    For example, if you enable **Pay order again** for **Open** orders, customers will be able to pay for the order by the link. 

        .. fancybox:: img/Pay-by-link_013.png

    Otherwise, they view the order details only without the ability to pay.


====================================
What's new on the order details page
====================================

    Navigate to **Orders** - **View orders** and select the order.

    .. fancybox:: img/Pay-by-link_3.png
        :alt: viewing orders

    On the opened order details page, find a new **Information by invitation link** block with two short links:

    .. fancybox:: img/Pay-by-link_4.png
        :alt: details order page

    * **Create new** button—Create a new link to view and a link to pay; previous links will become inactive.

    * **Disable** button—Disable links for this order.

    * **Status**—Two options: *Active* - links to view and to pay are active, the order is not paid; *Used* - the link is used.

    .. fancybox:: img/Pay-by-link_014.png
        :alt: order paid with the link

    * **Link to view**—A link to view the order details.

    * **Link to pay**—A link to pay for the order.

    .. important::

        The **Link to pay** is created **only** for external payment methods which use ``cc_outside.tpl``. Check the template for your payment method on the Administration > Payment methods page in the payment method properties. 
        The add-on is **incompatible** with the **custom payment methods** and generates the **link to pay** only for the **CS-Cart default payment methods**. 

        .. fancybox:: img/Pay-by-link_015.png
            :alt: paying the order


        If the payment method uses another ``tpl``, the **Link to pay** will not be created and the customer will not get this link in the email.
