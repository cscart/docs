Managing in the admin panel
---------------------------

=====================
Installing the add-on
=====================

    Install the Cloud Translate add-on on the add-ons list page (Add-ons â†’ Manage add-ons). Click the + button in the top right corner, select an archive and click Upload & install. You can now find the installed add-on in the list of installed add-ons, just make sure it is set to Active.

=====================
Setting up the add-on
=====================

    The settings of the Cloud Translate add-on are divided into the following sections:

    **Google Translate API settings**

    .. fancybox:: img/Cloud_translation_002.png
        :alt: Cloud Translate API key

    In the API field, enter the API key from your Google Cloud Translation account. To do so, you'll need to create an account in the `Google Cloud Platform <https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/getting-started>`_ and get the API key in the **Credentials** section.

    .. fancybox:: img/Cloud_translation_007.png

    **Google Translate languages**

    This section contains a list of **Languages** (target languages), which are languages being translated to, and **Base language** (source language), which is a language being translated from.

    **Google Translate API events**

    This section contains a list of events that trigger translation on the website. Here are available options:

    .. fancybox:: img/Cloud_translation_004.png
        :alt: events that trigger translation

    * **Update entity via website**

    If enabled, the text in the target language will be automatically updated when you are changing something in the text in the source language.
    
    Say you have created a text in Japanese (source language) and translated it into English (target language) with the Cloud Translate service. You have also made some stylistic changes in the English language text. Later, you would like to make some changes in the Japanese text. If the setting is enabled, the English text will be translated again when you change the one in Japanese. It is not recommended to set the setting to active.

    * **Create entity via website**

    If enabled, the new fields filled in the source language will be automatically translated into the target language.

    For example, there is no short description in a product. You are creating one in English and it is automatically created in the Japanese version of the product.

    * **Create products via import**

    CS-Cart supports CSV import of products. You can also use the `XML import add-on <https://www.simtechdev.com/addons/site-management/xml-import.html>`_ to create new products.

    If the setting is enabled, the description in the second language will be automatically created when you are making an import.

    To get more details on how the import works, please refer to the `CS-Cart documentation <http://docs.cs-cart.com/4.3.x/user_guide/import_export/index.html>`_. We also have a couple of `videos explaining how the XML import add-on works <https://goo.gl/vEeufZ>`_.

    * **Update products via import**

    It means that if you are updating a product automatically the translation can be changed as well.

    **Fields to translate**

    Select fields of the entities that you want to translate on your site:

    .. fancybox:: img/Cloud_translation_005.png
        :alt: Fields to translate

    If you want to translate the entire site, you can do so by setting the CRON in the CRON settings tab.

    .. fancybox:: img/Cloud_translation_006.png
        :alt: translate the entire site

    The **Translate what is already translated** setting allows to translate entities regardless of earlier translations.

===============================
Translating individual entities
===============================

    You can also translate selective entities, like products, categories, pages by clicking the gear button of the corresponding entity.

    Here's an example of translating the Contact us form.

    .. fancybox:: img/Cloud_translation_008.png
        :alt: translate the site

    Here's the translated form in French:

    .. fancybox:: img/Cloud_translation_009.png
        :alt: contact us form

===========================
Administrator notifications
===========================

   The site admin will be notified when the entire site is translated by cron as well as when products created or updated via import are translated.

   You can edit the email templates by navigating to **Design - Email templates - Administrator notifications**.
