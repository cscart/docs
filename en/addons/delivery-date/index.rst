Overview
--------

    The `Delivery Date <https://www.simtechdev.com/addons/customer-experience/delivery-date.html>`_ add-on creates a nice date picker at the Shipping options step at checkout to let customers select a date and time when they’d like to receive the order. Customers can also leave a message if they want.

    Once the order is placed, the customer will see the selected delivery date and time in the order details.

    You can see delivery dates on the orders list page so you can very quickly see when orders are due to be fulfilled.

    You can edit the selected delivery date via the admin panel on the order details page, if needed.

    Orders can also be exported/imported with the delivery date field in the CSV format to share with shipping services.
