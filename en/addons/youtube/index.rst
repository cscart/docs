Overview
--------

    `The YouTube Gallery add-on <https://www.simtechdev.com/addons/customer-experience/youtube.html>`_ is a simple-to-use extension that makes it easy to add YouTube videos to your CS-Cart store, or create a video gallery on the category page. 
    Make description of your products more informative and attract more customers to your store.

    You can now add not only pictures of your products, but also a quick video showing your product in movement, being worn, or just to scale. Whatever your product does or is capable of, let your potential customers see it in better detail.

    Hereâ€™s a look.

    You can also add a video at the end after all additional images.

    Alternatively, you can choose to display videos in the product tab.

    You can choose which videos you want to show by simply specifying their URLs. The add-on allows you to include titles and player controls if you like, but that is optional.

    The add-on also creates a YouTube icon on product thumbnails on the products list page. When hovering over a product, the icon will be highlighted red, inviting the customer to play the video:

    You can add a video to any page you like, for instance, the registration page to explain how the Referral program works in your store and motivate your customers to register (see `Affiliate PRO <https://www.simtechdev.com/docs/addons/affiliate/index.html>`_):
