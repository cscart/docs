Overview
--------

    Make sure your customers know when you are open with our **Vendor Schedule** add-on. 

    It allows vendors to show whether their store is currently open or closed. If it's closed, all products will be hidden from the storefront and search results and a note will be displayed below the company logo.

    Vendors can set their days off using a nice calendar in the vendor panel.

    They can also set opening time and closing time of their store.

    The admin gets a notification when a vendor goes on vacation and is back from vacation and the products become available on the storefront again.

    Simply install the add-on, make a few adjustments, and you’re all set!

Managing the calendar
=====================

    The Vendor Schedule add-on allows the admin and vendors to select vacation days on the calendar during which all vendor's products will be hidden from the storefront and search results and a corresponding note will be displayed below the store logo:

    .. fancybox:: img/Vendor_business_hours_004.png
        :alt: Vendor Schedule add-on. Store is closed

    To do this, in the vendor panel the vendor should navigate to **Vendors - Vendors**.

    There will be a new column added to see which of the vendors are currently on vacation. 

    .. fancybox:: img/Vendor_business_hours_005.png

    Click on the vendor name and open the **Business hours** tab.

    The vendor can select the dates when their storefront will be unavailable.

    By selecting **Unlimited vacation** option, products on the vendor's storefront will get unavailable for an unlimited period of time. The admin will be notified of this immediately.

    The vendor can also set opening hours for their store by using the **The store opens at** and **The store closes at** settings.

    .. note::

        The time and dates are set in accordance with the vendor's time zone.
