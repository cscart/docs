Overview
--------

    **The CS-Cart Blocks Animation add-on** allows you to apply the animation effect to the blocks on any page of your store with just a click. It makes your website dynamic and provides an interesting experience for your customers. With the add-on, you get a set of nice animation effects, like scale up, scale down, fade in, appear on the left, appear on the right, etc. Animations will start when the animated blocks appear as you scroll down the page.

    Animated page elements do not alter content of the store, but provide a more extraordinary user experience. Website animation can be fun and looks appealing to new visitors.

    **Animation duration** - the minimum animation duration is 0.3 seconds (animation duration set to 1). Each subsequent value is calculated by multiplying the value by this number. For example, if you select 2 for this field, the animation will last 0.6 seconds (0.3*2 = 0.6). If you select 3, the animation will last 0.9 seconds (0.3*3 = 0.9).

    **Animation delay** - by default the animation will start when the block becomes visible. You can add a delay providing a value for this field. Keep in mind that value 1 equals 0.3 seconds. Each subsequent value is multiplied by the corresponding number. For example: if you select 2 for this field, the animation will start 0.6 seconds after the block becomes visible (0.3*2 = 0.6).

    **Animation speed** - select the way you want the animation to begin and end: 

    - animation begins slowly and speeds up by the end

    - animation begins and ends slowly

    - same animation speed from beginning to the end
