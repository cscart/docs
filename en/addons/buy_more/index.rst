    CS-Cart language variables can also be used in the message.  Due to dynamic and dependency of language variables on the promotion conditions, we suggest the following list:

    * **promo_name** - name of the promotion, taken from the General tab

    * **currency_symbol** - symbol of the selected currency

    Variables with **condition** prefix contains the same data mentioned in the Condition tab:

    * **condition_{name of the condition}** - displays the name of the condition

    * **condition_value_{name of the condition}** - displays the values required to apply the promotion

    Variables with the **bonus** prefix contain the same data mentioned in the Bonuses tab:

    * **bonus_{name of the bonus}** -  displays the name of the bonus

    * **bonus_value_{name of the bonus}** - displays the value of the bonus (i.e. shipping method of the amount of the discount)

    Variables with the **diff** prefix display the difference between the required and the actual quantity of the products in the cart:

    * **diff_{name of the condition}** -  displays the quantity of the products to add to the cart

    * **diff = condition_value** - displays the total amount of the cart required to apply the promotion

    .. note::
        Every language requires special message

============================================================================================

        * Create a new promotion and select *Order Subtotal* in the *Conditions* tab. Select one of the following operators: greater, equal, greater or equal. For example, we have selected greater or equal $500 and clicked Save button. Thus, we have selected the subtotal amount to get the promotion bonus from.
