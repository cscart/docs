    .. note::
        You could finish setting up of Facebook app on this step and go to installation and setting up of the Insragram Widget add-on step `Managing in the admin panel`_. In this case, Insragram Widget add-on will work via the test Facebook app in your store. The test Facebook app would be enough if you are going to use only the main Facebook account. 
       
        Currently, Insragram Widget add-on works correctly with test Facebook app and you could use it on your own responsibility without getting reviews for the main app.
        Otherwise, you could continue setting Facebook on the step `App review on Facebook`_.
