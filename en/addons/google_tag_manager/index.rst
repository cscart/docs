Overview
--------

    **Tag Manager** is a professional instrument for modern marketers that allows to quickly manage tags and code snippets on your website. Instead of editing your website code or asking developers to do that for you, you can now easily add and update Google tags or any custom tags directly from the Tag Manager interface. 

    The **Tag Manager** add-on integrates Tag Manager into your website, which will free you from having to involve developers when configuring tags. All you need to do is just follow simple instructions below.

    With our add-on, you will be able to track real-time events, like adding a product to cart, adding a product to wish list or comparison list, in your Google Analytics account.

Frequently asked questions
==========================

+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Tag not fired through GTM
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

    If you have both Google Analytics tags and Tag Manager code on your site at the same time, the Tag Assistant extension can display the "Tag not fired through GTM" notice.

    .. fancybox:: img/tag_assistant.png
        :alt: Tag not fired through GTM
        :width: 300px

    Please note that it is normal behavior and it is not a critical error. It happens due to both Google Analytics and Tag Manager are trying to track events in your store, so events may get duplicated.

    In this situation, we recommend to continue using the `Google Analytics add-on <http://docs.simtechdev.com/addons/google_analytics_enhanced_ecommerce/index.html>`_ as it can definitely track more events in the store and you do not have to manually insert any tags to the code of your site. In this case, you can use Tag Manager to deploy other kinds of tags.

    But if you want to use Tag Manager anyway, you can disable the Google Analytics add-on in your store and create a Universal Analytics tag within Tag Manager.

Code found outside of <body> tag
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    .. fancybox:: img/ignore_error.png
        :alt: Tag not fired through GTM
        :width: 300px

    Google recommends to ignore this error. The recommendations for `how to implement the Tag Manager container code <https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/quickstart>`_ have changed. While implementations with the container code entirely in the <body> will continue to work as is, it’s now recommended that the container code be split, with the <script> portion in the <head> and the <noscript> portion in the <body>. Further context may be found in `this blog post <https://analytics.googleblog.com/2016/10/spotlight-on-google-tag-manager-open.html>`_. This false error will be resolved in a future update. In the meantime, you may ignore this error.

How to track Google Analytics events in Tag Manager
----------------------------------------------------------

    Event Tracking with Google Analytics is essential for understanding the user actions on your website such as how many times a product was added to cart, removed from cart, bought in one click, etc. This can be done by using the **Data Layer Event code**.

    A **data layer** is an object that contains all of the information that you want to pass to Tag Manager. Information such as events or variables can be passed to Tag Manager via the data layer, and triggers can be set up in Tag Manager based on specific events.

    The following events will be passed to Tag Manager via the data layer:

    - add to cart

    - remove from cart

    - add to wish list

    - add to comparison list

    - buy in one click

    - call request

    Our add-on frees you from having to implement the Data Layer Event code by yourself, but you will need to set up events in your Tag Manager account.

=======================================
Setting up events in Tag Manager
=======================================

    1. Log in to your Tag Manager account.

    2. Select **Tags** from the left and click **New** to create a new tag.

    .. fancybox:: img/google-tag-manager-001.png

    3. Select **Universal Analytics** from **Tag Type**.

    .. fancybox:: img/google-tag-manager-002.png
        :alt: adding a new tag
        :width: 636px

    4. Choose **Event** for the track type and set your event tracking parameters as desired. Note: This is how your events will be named within Google Analytics.

    .. fancybox:: img/google-tag-manager-003.png
        :alt: adding a new tag
        :width: 418px

    5. Then start setting your triggers. Click the **+** button to create a new trigger.

    .. fancybox:: img/google-tag-manager-005.png
        :alt: adding a new tag
        :width: 627px

    7. Enter the **Event name**.

    .. fancybox:: img/google-tag-manager-006.png
        :alt: adding a new tag
        :width: 533px

    You can find the event name in the add-on settings.

    .. fancybox:: img/google-tag-manager-007.png
        :alt: adding a new tag

    8. Click **Save**.

    9. Name the trigger and click **Save**.

    .. fancybox:: img/google-tag-manager-008.png
        :alt: adding a new tag
        :width: 442px

    10. Click **Submit** in the top right corner. Then click **Publish** and **Continue**.

    .. fancybox:: img/google-tag-manager-010.png
        :alt: publishing a tag in Tag Manager

    Done.

    Setting the tag for Event Tracking is the same process every time. The difference comes with creating the triggers that fire.

    For more detailed instructions, please refer to `this article <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6164470?hl=en>`_.

=======================================
Checking statistics of triggered events
=======================================

    Now that you've set events and triggers in Tag Manager, it's to time to see that it's performing correctly.

    Log in to your Google Analytics account and open **Real-time events**. When a user performs an action that you track, it will appear in the statistics in real time. You will see how many users are visiting your site right now and what actions they perform.
