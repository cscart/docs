Overview
--------

    **The CS-Cart Show me more add-on** is a super useful extension that allows you to automatically load infinite number of products on the search page, category page, and vendor's products page. Basically, as the user scrolls through content, more content is loaded automatically. Infinite scrolling offers an efficient way to browse massive amounts of items, without having to wait for pages to preload. Rather, the user enjoys a truly responsive experience, whatever device they’re using.

    You can load more products in two ways:

    * by scrolling down the page

        :alt: Show more by click

    * by clicking the "Show more" button:

    .. fancybox:: img/screenshot.jpg
        :alt: Show more by click

    The Show me more add-on also allows to add the "Show more" button for product blocks (for example, On Sale, Hot deals). With this feature, you can offer your customers more items they might be interested in.

        :alt: settings of the Layouts for devices add-on

    * **Hide pagination**—Hide pagination from the category and search pages.

    If you choose to leave pagination on the page, your customers will be able to easily navigate on a long page of loaded items. If items are already loaded on the page, when the customer clicks the page number, they will be smoothly taken to the top of the corresponding page.

    .. fancybox:: img/Show_me_more_Selection_004.png

    * **Number of shown products**—If enabled, the number of shown products will be displayed below the "Show more" button on the category and search pages.

    * **Add the "Show more" button**—Adds the "Show more" button below the block allowing to load additional elements. If selected, the Element limits settings will get available.

    * **Element limits**—The number of loaded elements. If not empty, it replaces the value of "Limit" in the "Content" tab. For example, if you enter 4 in this field, 4 items will be displayed in the block and each time the "Show more" button is clicked, 4 more items will be loaded.

    * **Number of shown products**—If enabled, the number of shown products will be displayed below the "Show more" button.
