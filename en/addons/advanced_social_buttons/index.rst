====================

    The Social Buttons PRO add-on allows you to create a new cart promotion in your store. If users share products in social networks, they can get bonuses for that. 

    To create a promotion, follow these quick steps:

    1. Go to **Marketing - Promotions**.

    2. Click the + button in the top right to create a new cart promotion.

    5. In the **Bonuses** tab, add a desired bonus for this promotion.

    .. tip::

        To learn more about the basics of creating promotions, refer to the `CS-Cart Docs <http://docs.cs-cart.com/4.3.x/user_guide/manage_products/promotions/index.html>`_.

    Once you've created a promotion, you can make a test order to make sure everything works fine.

    To do this:

    1. Under a test user share a product.

    2. Add the product to cart and proceed to checkout.

======================================
How to a hook for versions 4.3.1-4.3.6
======================================

    .. important::

        If your CS-Cart or Multi-Vendor store runs on versions 4.3.1-4.3.6, you'll need to insert a hook to make the add-on perform correctly. 

    To do this, please follow the steps below:

    Open the **app/functions/fn.cart.php** file.

    In the **fn_checkout_place_order** function, before this line:

    .. code::

        fn_order_placement_routines('route', $order_id);

    add this one:

    .. code::

        fn_set_hook('checkout_place_orders_pre_route', $cart, $auth, $params);

    Example:

    .. code::

        if (empty($params['skip_payment']) && $process_payment == true || (!empty($params['skip_payment']) && empty($auth['act_as_user'])))
        { $payment_info = !empty($cart['payment_info']) ? $cart['payment_info'] : array(); fn_start_payment($order_id, array(), $payment_info); }
        // added hook checkout_place_orders_pre_route
        fn_set_hook('checkout_place_orders_pre_route', $cart, $auth, $params);
        fn_order_placement_routines('route', $order_id);
