Overview
--------

    Understanding customer preferences is very important whether you are selling a product or offering a service. This is because customers are the determiners of how successful a company becomes. The **Product Likes** add-on is the best way to get to know your customers' likes and dislikes, which will definitely help you increase sales.

    The **Product Likes** add-on allows users to like any product in your store. The **LIKE** button is added to product details pages. They can also see the likes count for the liked products.

        :alt: Product likes

    The **Product Likes** add-on creates a new **My likes page** in the user account. Customers can save desired products in this list by liking them. They can return to any product later and add it to cart right from this page. It is an effective way to reduce shopping cart abandonment.

    If you use the `Profile Page add-on <https://www.simtechdev.com/addons/customer-experience/user-profile-page.html>`_, you can show the products the user likes on the profile page. Clicking **View all** link will open the page with all liked products.

    If you'd like, you can show the **Most liked products** block containing the most popular products in your store and **My likes** block containing products the user liked.

    .. fancybox:: img/homepage-blocks.png

    Your customers will be able to sort products by the number of likes: from low to high and from high to low.
