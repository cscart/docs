Overview
--------

    Do you have any items in your store you'd like to sell together, like a t-shirt and shorts? Do you want to make more money from every customer that visits your store? `The Product Bundles add-on <https://www.simtechdev.com/addons/marketing/product-bundles.html>`_ can make it possible!

    The add-on lets you **encourage your customers to buy more** by offering special discounts for a set.

    .. fancybox:: img/Product-bundles_035.png
        :alt: Product bundles

    In case a product has options, like size, color, customers can choose the ones they prefer.

    .. fancybox:: img/Product-bundles_044.png
        :alt: Product bundles

    The Product Bundles add-on allows you to **enhance the product details page** with the following features:

    1. Product bundles link to the page with a list of bundles (see `Adding bundles list link to Quick links`_)

    2. Product bundles (see `Creating product bundles`_)

    3. Bundle filters (see `Creating bundle filter`_)

    4. List of all created product bundles (see `Creating bundles list`_).

    5. Compatibility with Direct Customer-to-Vendor add-on 

    .. fancybox:: img/Product-bundles_032.png
        :alt: Product bundles

    The add-on also creates a page to **show all product bundles available in the store**. Add the link to this page to Quick links to make it accessible to your customers (see `Adding bundles list link to Quick links`_).

    .. fancybox:: img/Product-bundles_033.png
        :alt: Product bundles
 
    Clicking on the bundle will take customers to the detailed bundle page with the **Add all to cart** button.

    .. fancybox:: img/Product-bundles_034.png
        :alt: Product bundles

    The last but not least noteworthy feature of Product Bundles is that they **appear in search results**. For example, if a customer searches for "video games", they will see not only related products, but also bundles containing related products. (See `Adding product bundles to the search results page`_.)

============
How it works
============

    Imagine, customer Tom is looking for an X-Box game and considering to get this one:

    .. fancybox:: img/Product-bundles_028.png
        :alt: Product bundles

    Then he sees an option to bundle and save, so if he buys two more games, he will save $27. Good deal, huh?

    .. fancybox:: img/Product-bundles_029.png
        :alt: Product bundles

    So Tom happily adds the entire bundle to cart.

    .. fancybox:: img/Product-bundles_031.png
        :alt: Product bundles
        :width: 637px

    The bundle will be added to cart like a single product, but Tom can still see products included in the bundle.

    .. fancybox:: img/Product-bundles_030.png
        :alt: Product bundles

    .. note::
        If one of the product is out of stock, the bundle can't be added to the cart and **Product is out of stock** notice will appear

    .. fancybox:: img/product-page.png
        :alt: Product bundles

    Here's how to create a perfect product bundle:

    1. Navigate to **Products** > **Product bundles**.

    .. fancybox:: img/Product-bundles_002.png
        :alt: Product bundles
        :width: 406px

    2. Click the **+** button in the top right.

    .. fancybox:: img/Product-bundles_003.png
        :alt: create a product bundle

    .. note::

        If you use Multi-Vendor, select an active vendor from the list of vendors at the top:

            .. fancybox:: img/Product-bundles_045.png
                :alt: create a product bundle

        The **+** button will not appear under all vendors mode.

            .. fancybox:: img/Product-bundles_046.png
                :alt: create a product bundle

    3. In the **General** tab, enter a name for the bundle (it will be shown on the product details page), add an image (it will be shown in the list of bundles), and optionally set a period during which the bundle will be available.

    .. fancybox:: img/general-tab.png
        :alt: Product bundles

            :alt: adding products

    6. Specify a discount amount and click **Recalculate**.

    For example, you can set 10% off each product:

    .. fancybox:: img/discount-value.png
        :alt: specify a discount amount

    Or you can set a share discount for all products:

    .. fancybox:: img/discount-product-bundle.png
        :alt: share discount

    Click **Apply** to see the discounted price.

    .. note::

        Customers will see the bundle price below the bundle. If you apply a percentage discount, the amount of percentage customers save will be shown:

            .. fancybox:: img/you-save.png
                :alt: share discount

    7. In the **SEO** tab, specify meta data for the bundle.

    .. fancybox:: img/seo-tab.png
        :alt: meta data for the bundle

    8. In the **Add-ons** tab, decide whether you want to allow payment of this bundle by reward points.

========================
Managing bundle statuses
========================

    Please pay attention to how the bundle statuses change:

    .. fancybox:: img/notice.png
        :alt: Product bundle status
    
    - If any of the prodcuts the bundle contains is **Disabled/Hidden**, you won't be able to enable the bundle. You will see the corresponding notification:

    .. fancybox:: img/notice-2.png
        :alt: Product bundle status

    You can update the statuses of product bundles manually:
