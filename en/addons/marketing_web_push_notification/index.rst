Overview
--------

    **The Marketings Notice add-on** allows you to send notifications via the Google Firebase service, to devices that support Web Push technology. Web Push Notifications is an important marketing communication and sales channel. Push notifications are much more effective than newsletters and advertising in search and social networks.

    As of April 2019, sending Web Push notifications is free.

    Web push notifications have several advantages over other content delivery channels to customers:

    - The notifications spring up at the customers' desktop. Independently of any interfaces.

    - The notification redirects the buyer directly to the store page without distracting actions.

    - Subscribing to notifications requires only 1 click.

    1. To create a notification go to to **Marketing > Web Push Notifications > Notifications** and click + in the top right corner.

    .. fancybox:: img/marketing_web_push_notification_creating_notification.jpg
        :alt: Marketings Notice add-on

    A window will be opened to add a new notification.    

    2. Fill in the following fields:

    .. fancybox:: img/marketing_web_push_notification_creating_notification2.jpg
        :alt: Marketings Notice add-on

    * **Title notifications** — 30 characters limit, message header (shown depending on the platform and browser version).

    * **Text notifications** — 120 characters limit, message body.

    * **Url** — A link to the landing page on which the customer will get after clicking on the notification.

    * **Image** — Notification image.

    * **Store/Vendor** — Storefront/Vendor to which the notification is attached. For Ultimate: messages will be shown in the choosen store. For Multi-Vendor: if you select a separate vendor, messages will be sent to those customers who visited the vendor page after agreeing to deliver notifications, if you do not select a vendor, then all active tokens will be sent.

    * **Status** — Notification status, there are 5 types:

        **New** — A new notification will be sent by the cron task when the corresponding setting is turned on, after sending it will switch to the Executed status.

        **Service** — The Service notification is available for selection in the add-on settings. It is used for sending out abandoned carts and sending to new users when the corresponding settings are enabled.

        **Deferred** — Deferred notifications are used to create messages that do not yet need to be sent. In the future, for distribution, you'll have to transfer them to the status New.

        **Executed** — The notifications with the New status get into this Executed status after the automatic distribution.

        **Reusable** — Notifications for repeated use, these notifications will be sent every time you start the cron (it is recommended to use it with extreme caution as if the cron is incorrectly configured then customers will take it for spam).

    * **Only registered users** — Mailing will be carried out only to tokens that are associated with registered users (in order for the token to link to an existing account, you must at least once authorize after you allow the delivery of notifications).

    3. After filling in the fields, click **Create**. 

    .. note::
        Since the add-on supports multilingualism, then at the time of creating the notification, versions are created for all the store languages, filling identically to the main notification. If you need to edit notifications for different languages, then switch to the desired language and make necessary changes. Fields supporting multilingualism:  Title notifications, Text notifications, Url, Image.

======================
Managing notifications
======================

    Notifications are managed in **Marketing > Web Push Notifications > Notifications**.

    .. fancybox:: img/marketing_web_push_notification_managing_notification.jpg
        :alt: Marketings Notice add-on

    There are 3 main blocks on this page:

    1. Notifications list

    This block displays the list of campaigns with the possibility of editing, forcing, deleting and changing the status.

    .. fancybox:: img/marketing_web_push_notification_list.jpg
        :alt: Marketings Notice add-on

    It also displays statistics on the latest campaign and the total number of transitions for all the time for notifications from this mailing (for the notifications sent out once, the statistics are displayed in the context of a campaign, while for Service campaign, the statistics are displayed in the context of periodic mailings and the total number of transitions will grow without dropping).

    .. fancybox:: img/marketing_web_push_notification_list2.jpg

    2. Multi-select control buttons and adding new notification

===============
Managing tokens
===============

    Tokens are managed in **Marketing > Web Push Notifications > Tokens**. On this page there are 3 main blocks.

    .. fancybox:: img/marketing_web_push_notification_managing_tokens.jpg
        :alt: Marketings Notice add-on

    1. Tokens list

    This block displays a list of tokens with the possibility of their activation, deactivation and deletion.

    .. fancybox:: img/marketing_web_push_notification_token_list.jpg
        :alt: Marketings Notice add-on

    Each token has a field *Failed amount* which shows how many notifications failed to get delivered. It's used to automatically disable the token when the corresponding setting is enabled.

    .. fancybox:: img/marketing_web_push_notification_managing_failed_amount.jpg

===================================================
Managing the permission of vendors to make mailings
===================================================

    The functionality of the Marketings Notice add-on allows vendors to be able to send out notifications to customers who came to their page after being allowed to deliver notifications to them.

    Collection of tokens for vendors is carried out only when the setting is enabled. Enable web push notifications for vendors:

    .. fancybox:: img/marketing_web_push_notification_vendors.jpg
        :alt: Marketings Notice add-on

    After enabling this setting, the main administrator must configure the ability to send campaigns for certain vendors: **Vendors > Choose a Vendor > Web Push notifications > Allow Web Push notifications**.

    .. note::
        It is recommended to provide the ability to send notifications only to trusted vendors, since if the customer forbids receiving notifications (as spammy), then notifications will not be delivered from the entire marketplace.

    .. fancybox:: img/marketing_web_push_notification_vendors2.jpg
        :alt: Marketings Notice add-on

------------------------------
Setting up Crons on the server
------------------------------

    To automatically send notifications, you must configure the cron on the server. The command for the cron is in the add-on settings in the tab Cron:

    .. fancybox:: img/marketing_web_push_notification_cron.jpg
        :alt: Marketings Notice add-on

    In this command, you need to replace the password with the cron from the store settings: **Settings > Security settings > Access key to cron script**.

    .. fancybox:: img/marketing_web_push_notification_managing_cron_password.jpg
        :alt: Marketings Notice add-on

.. note:: The recommended cron frequency is once per day.

==============================================
Configuring Cron Mailing for New Notifications
==============================================

    After setting the cron, if you want the new notifications to be sent out automatically, without forced sending, you need to enable the setting **New notification sent** in the Cron tab.

    .. fancybox:: img/marketing_web_push_notification_new_notifications.jpg
        :alt: Marketings Notice add-on

    When this setting is enabled, new notifications that the administrator will create will be automatically sent the next time the cron is executed.
 
============================================
Configuring Cron Mailing for New Subscribers
============================================

    If you want to send notifications to new subscribers, you need to enable the setting **Use notification for new subscribers** in Cron tab and choose the message which will be sent. In order for the notification to appear in the list, you need to create a new notification with the status Service (see `Creating notifications`_).

    .. fancybox:: img/marketing_web_push_notification_managing_new_subscribers.jpg
        :alt: Marketings Notice add-on

    Subscribers are considered as new if their tokens, after allowing the delivery of notifications were not sent a notification for new subscribers.

============================================
Configuring Cron Mailing for Abandoned Carts
============================================

    If you want to launch a campaign for abandoned carts, you need to enable the setting **Use notification for abandoned carts** in Cron tab and choose the message which will be sent. In order for the notification to appear in the list, you need to create a new notification with the status Service (see `Creating notifications`_).

    .. fancybox:: img/marketing_web_push_notification_managing_abandoned_carts.jpg
        :alt: Marketings Notice add-on

    The cron collects abandoned carts for the latest 24 hours.

==========================================================
Configuring Cron Mailing for automatic Bad Tokens Shutdown
==========================================================

    It is recommended to enable the setting **Use bad tokens shutdown**, as disabling tokens for which it is impossible to deliver a notification will reduce the load on the server at the time of sending notifications.

    After enabling this setting, you will need to configure the number of unsuccessful deliveries, after which the token will be disabled (default 20).
