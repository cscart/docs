Overview
--------

    The **Animation Effects** add-on shows animated *Add to cart*, *Add to wish list*, *Add to comparison list*, and *Quick view* buttons over the product image on the products list page. These buttons appear when the customer hovers the mouse pointer over the product image. The buttons are clickable and perform the appropriate actions.

    It makes your website dynamic and provides an interesting experience for your customers.

    Here's a quick look.
