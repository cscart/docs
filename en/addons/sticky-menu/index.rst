Managing in the admin panel

=====================
Installing the add-on
=====================

    Install the Sticky Menu add-on on the add-ons list page (“Add-ons” → ”Manage add-ons”). Click the + button in the top right corner, select an archive, and click **Upload & install**. You can now find the installed add-on in the list of installed add-ons, just make sure it is set to Active.

=====================
Setting up the add-on
=====================

To set up the add-on, configure the following settings:

    .. fancybox:: img/Sticky_menu_03.png
        :alt: add-on settings

* **License key**—Enter the license key to activate the add-on. You will receive this key in the order confirmation email. You can also see license keys for all your purchased add-ons in your HelpDesk account.

* **Background color**—Choose the color for the sticky grid.

* **Animation duration (ms)**—Set up how fast the sticky panel will appear in milliseconds. The larger this number is, the slower it will move forward.

* **Scroll direction for panel display**—There are two possible scenarios here. The sticky panel may appear when the customer scrolls the page up or down. Here is how it looks like when the **Up** option is active:

The sticky bar appears only when the user scrolls the page down and then scrolls it up. This mode is useful for menus: make the menu sticky to improve navigation for customers who intend to leave that page.

And here is the example of the **Down** option activated. The menu appears immediately when the user scrolls the page down.

======================
Creating a sticky menu
======================

    You can make any existing grid of the layout stick to the top by choosing the **Sticky header** option in the **Wrapper** field in the grid options.

    .. fancybox:: img/Sticky_menu_09.png
        :alt: Sticky menu

    .. attention::

        **If you make some grid sticky, it will disappear from the page and will be shown only in the sticky panel.**

        If you want to show the grid both on the page and in the sticky menu, duplicate it in the layout settings:

            .. fancybox:: img/Sticky_menu_18.png
                :alt: Sticky menu

    For example, you would like to create a sticky menu panel with a menu. 

    1. Add an additional grid to the header or top panel and select the **Sticky header** option in the **Wrapper**

    .. fancybox:: img/Sticky_menu_01.png       
       :alt: Sticky menu

    2. Add the new menu block and set it up according to your needs (you can change its filling following the `CS-Cart documentation <https://docs.cs-cart.com/latest/user_guide/look_and_feel/menus/index.html>`_)

====================================
Creating a bar with several elements
====================================

    Let’s create a menu with a logo, a search field, and a cart like this:

    .. fancybox:: img/Sticky_menu_12.png
        :alt: Sticky menu

    1. Navigate to **Design** > **Layouts**.

    2. Add a grid with the **Sticky header** option activated to the top panel or header. Add 3 grids inside it and fill them with the desired blocks. In our case, they are the Logo, Search, and Cart content blocks in the grids with width 3, 11, and 2 accordingly.

    3. Set up the display of grids on different devices if necessary.
