Overview
--------

    The `Clone Categories <https://www.simtechdev.com/addons/site-management/clone-categories.html>`_ add-on allows you to clone product categories, with their subcategories and products or without them. While cloning a category, all main information will be cloned like its name, location, description, images, meta data, availability, layouts. Any modifications made by third-party add-ons will not be cloned.

    This add-on can be especially useful for those who create complex categories with multiple subcategries. So you won't have to manually fill in all fields again and again, you can get a copy of an existing category with just a few clicks.
