Overview

    Add an extra layer of protection to your account with 2-Step Verification by Google, also known as Two-Factor Authentication.

        :alt: Two-Factor Authentication for CS-Cart

    Two-step verification uses both your password and an extra security code to verify your identity whenever you sign in to your account. If someone else tries to access your account, even if they can guess your password, they still won’t be able to get in without using two-step verification.

    .. attention::

        For correct performance of the add-on make sure that the time on your server is correct. Contact your system administrator or our technical support team if you need help.

    Two-step authentication is one of the best ways to prevent unauthorized access to your account. Follow the directions below to know how to do it.

============
How it works
============

    Sign in to the store like you normally do by entering your username and password.

    Then you'll be asked to enter a verification code, which you'll get from the Google Authenticator app.
