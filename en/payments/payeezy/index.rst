What the customer will see
--------------------------

    Once you've set up the Payeezy Gateway in the store, it will get available to your customers.

    So the customer adds products to cart and proceeds to checkout. At the Billing Options step, they will see the Payeezy payment method available.

    To pay for the order via Payeezy, the customer should enter the credit card details:

    .. fancybox:: img/Payeezy_Selection_010.png
        :alt: Paying by credit card. Payeezy

    Once the payment is made successfully, the customer will see the following notification:

    .. fancybox:: img/Payeezy_Selection_011.png
        :alt: payment is made successfully

    In the backend, the admin will see new parameters on the order details page (Orders - View orders):

    .. fancybox:: img/Payeezy_Selection_012.png
        :alt: viewing orders

    These parameters are necessary to identify orders on the Payeezy end.
