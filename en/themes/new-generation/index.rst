Overview
--------

    New Generation Theme is designed with a focus on UX and UI elements of the young generation, the rising shopping power the next years.  The UX and UI effects consider the behavioral patterns of Gen Zers who prefer to swipe and scroll, a simplified navigation to switch between tabs, impressive banners to get a quick path to promotional campaigns, sharing buttons to engage friends with their preferences. The New Generation Theme got a functionality to remind about the last actions to the visitor. It also offers  a handy solution to quickly view the shopping cart. Designers made a provision in the design template to retain wandering minds of new shoppers with a smart arrangement of elements on the storefront.
