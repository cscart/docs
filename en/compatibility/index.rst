CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor Compatibility
----------------------------------------

    We develop the add-ons according to the CS-Cart standards and use the built-in capabilities to expand default functionality, using PHP 7.
    Add-ons depend on the version of either CS-Cart or Multi-Vendor. Each add-on has its own limitations in terms of compatibility with the CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor version.
    Our add-ons are compatible with default CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor add-ons.

---------------------------
PHP Version Compatibility
---------------------------

    Part of our add-ons are compatible with php 5.6, the other part requires php 7.
    The more detailed information is presented on the product pages on marketplaces and documentation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Compatibility with the third-party developments and customizations
-------------------------------------------------------------------

    We cannot guarantee full compatibility with third-party themes and add-ons.
    We cannot guarantee that our add-ons will be fully compatible with heavily customized projects either.
    If you use customizations on your project, we recommend consulting your developers prior purchasing our add-ons and themes.
