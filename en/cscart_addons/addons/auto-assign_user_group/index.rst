    The **Auto-Assign User Group** add-on allows you to automatically assign newly created users to a specific user group.

    The main benefit of the add-on is that it simplifies management of new users:

    - automatically assign a user group (Customer → User groups)

=====================
Setting up the add-on
=====================

    You will see a list of available user groups in the **Default user group** select box. Simply select a group that a new user should be automatically assigned to, and hit **Save**. From that point on, every new user created via registration form will automatically belong to the specified group.

    If no user group has been created yet, you'll see only the **No** option.
