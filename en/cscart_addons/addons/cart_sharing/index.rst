--------
Overview
--------

    **The Cart Sharing add-on** lets your customers share the contents of their cart with anyone else. They share not only products in the their cart, but also their personal preferences and reasons why they choose this product exactly from your store. This will attract more potential buyers to your store and encourage them to shop based on their friends' shopping experience.

============
How it works
============

    Your customers add products to cart, copy the link to their cart on the cart page and share it with friends in private messages:

    or share it on Facebook, Twitter, or other social network:

==========================
Cart sharing for customers
==========================

    Once the customer added products to cart, they go to the cart page to view the cart contents. There, they will see a new field added: **Link to the cart**.

    .. fancybox:: img/Selection_03.png
        :alt: Link to cart contents

    Using this link, customers can share the cart contents between each other: simply copy/paste the link to send it in an email, message, or post it on Facebook, Twitter, etc.

    .. fancybox:: img/Selection_04.png

    or checkout depending on the add-on settings (see the `Setting up the add-on`_ section above):
