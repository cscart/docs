    Use the following commands:

    php /path/to/cart/admin.php --dispatch=advanced_mailing_list_cron.update --cron_password=CRON_PASSWORD

    php /path/to/cart/admin.php --dispatch=advanced_mailing_list_cron.abandoned_carts --cron_password=CRON_PASSWORD

    * **Update mailing lists with users in the user groups**:

    php /path/to/cart/admin.php --dispatch=advanced_mailing_list_cron.usergroups --cron_password=CRON_PASSWORD

    where:

    **path/to/cart** is the path to your website

    **CRON_PASSWORD** is the access key to the cron script that you can find under **Settings > Security settings**.

    .. note:

        If you have any difficulties with setting up cron, please contact your server administrator or `contact us <https://www.simtechdev.com/helpdesk>`_ for help.

        :alt: reward points field

    6. Click **Save changes**.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Step 2. Setting up a mailing list
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    In the admin panel of your store,

    1. Go to **Marketing > Advanced mailing lists**.

    2. Select the list you set up in MailChimp at the previous step.

    3. Switch to the **Fields mapping** tab.

    4. Select the **Others: Reward points** field for the Profile field and **Reward points** for the MailChimp field.

    .. fancybox:: img/MailChimp_Advanced_032.png
        :alt: reward points field

        .. fancybox:: img/MailChimp_Advanced_033.png
            :alt: reward points field

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Step 3. Updating values in MailChimp
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    You'll need to update information about the number of reward points your customers have in MailChimp. You can do this in two ways:

    **Option 1. Manually**

    1. Go to **Customers > Customers**.

    2. Select the necessary customers, then click the gear button in the top right corner and select **Update information in MailChimp**.

    .. fancybox:: img/MailChimp_Advanced_034.png
        :alt: reward points field

    **Option 2. By cron script**

    You can choose to update customer information, including the number of reward points customers have, automatically. To do so, you'll need to set up a cron job on your server to run it according to a schedule. In this case you will not need to update customer information manually each time they receive reward points.

    Use the following command:

    **php /path/to/cart/admin.php --dispatch=advanced_mailing_list_cron.update --cron_password=CRON_PASSWORD**

    where: 

    **path/to/cart** is the path to your website

    **CRON_PASSWORD** is the access key to the cron script that you can find under **Settings > Security settings**.

    .. note:

        If you have any difficulties with setting up cron, please contact your server administrator or `contact us <https://www.simtechdev.com/helpdesk>`_ for help.

    Once you update information in MailChimp, you will see values in the contacts list:

    .. fancybox:: img/MailChimp_Advanced_035.png

=========================================================
Creating a mailing list of customers with abandoned carts
=========================================================

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Step 1. Setting up your MailChimp account

    .. fancybox:: img/MailChimp_Advanced_038.png
        :alt: adding a field

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Step 2. Creating a mailing list
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    In the admin panel of your store,

    1. Go to **Marketing > Advanced mailing lists**.

    2. Click the **+** button to add a new mailing list.

    3. In the **General** tab, give it a name, select the MailChimp list you've created at the previous step, and in the **Actions** drop-down select **Abandoned/Live carts**.

        :alt: general settings

    4. In the **Fields mapping** tab, map the CS-Cart and MailChimp fields:

    .. fancybox:: img/MailChimp_Advanced_039a.png
        :alt: fields mapping

    5. Click **Create**.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Step 3. Adding users to the mailing list
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    You can do that in two ways: manually via the admin panel or automatically via a cron job on the server.

    In the admin panel of your store,

    1. Go to **Marketing > Abandoned/Live carts**.

    2. Select the users whom you want to add to the mailing list, click the **gear** button in the top right corner, and select **Add to mailing list**.

    .. fancybox:: img/MailChimp_Advanced_040.png
        :alt: adding users to mailing list

    3. In the pop-up, select the mailing list you've created at the previous step. Click **Add to mailing list**.

    .. fancybox:: img/MailChimp_Advanced_042.png
        :alt: fields mapping

    .. note::

        Unregistered users will not be imported to MailChimp.

    .. fancybox:: img/MailChimp_Advanced_043.png
        :alt: mailing list of users with abandoned carts

    Alternatively, you can add users to the mailing list automatically. To do so, you will need to set up a cron job on the server where your store is installed.

    Use the following command:

    **php /path/to/cart/admin.php --dispatch=advanced_mailing_list_cron.abandoned_carts --cron_password=CRON_PASSWORD**

    where:

    **path/to/cart** is the path to your website

    **CRON_PASSWORD** is the access key to the cron script that you can find under **Settings > Security settings**.

    .. note:

        If you have any difficulties with setting up cron, please contact your server administrator or `contact us <https://www.simtechdev.com/helpdesk>`_ for help.

    Now it's time to create automated newsletters. Follow `this guide <http://kb.mailchimp.com/automation/create-an-automation>`_ to learn how.

    2. Click the **+** button to add a new mailing list.

Step 3. Adding users to the mailing list
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    You can do that in two ways: manually via the admin panel or automatically via a cron job on the server.

    In the admin panel of your store,

    1. Go to **Customers > User groups**.

    2. Select the necessary user group which you want to synchronize with MailChimp, click the **gear** button in the top right corner, and select **Update information in MailChimp**.

    3. The customers in the user group will be added to the corresponding list in MailChimp. Go back to the MailChimp list to see a list of contacts:

    Alternatively, you can add users to the mailing list automatically. To do so, you will need to set up a cron job on the server where your store is installed.

    Use the following command:

    **php /path/to/cart/admin.php --dispatch=advanced_mailing_list_cron.usergroups --cron_password=CRON_PASSWORD**

    where:

    **path/to/cart** is the path to your website

    **CRON_PASSWORD** is the access key to the cron script that you can find under **Settings > Security settings**.

    .. note:

        If you have any difficulties with setting up cron, please contact your server administrator or `contact us <https://www.simtechdev.com/helpdesk>`_ for help.

    Now it's time to create automated newsletters. Follow `this guide <http://kb.mailchimp.com/automation/create-an-automation>`_ to learn how.
