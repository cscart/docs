How To: Set up the Google Analytics add-on
******************************************

The **Google Analytics** add-on is created in order to allow the administrator to see the statistics for CS-Cart on his Google account. This add-on is based on `Universal Analytics <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2790010?hl=en>`_.

To set up the **Google Analytics** add-on:

*   In the Administration panel, go to **Add-ons → Manage add-ons** and enable the **Google Analytics** add-on (change its status to *Active* in the select box on the right).
*   Click on the name of the add-on.
*   Enter the **Universal Analytics** account number into the **Google Analytics account number** field.

.. note ::

	The **Universal Analytics** account number is the value of the *_uacct* variable in the Google Analytics Tracking Code. For example, if you see *_uacct= "UA-1111111-1"* you should put *UA-1111111-1* in the **Google Analytics account number** field.

*   If you would like to track your CS-Cart orders, enable the **Track e-commerce transactions** option. Then you should select *Yes* in the **E-commerce website** option on the profile page of your site in your Universal Analytics account. You will be able to view reports under the **E-commerce** section of your Universal Analytics account.
*   Click the **Save** button.

.. note ::

	In order to get the **Universal Analytics** account number you should create your own account on the `Google Analytics <http://www.google.com/analytics>`_ site. After that you will be able to obtain this number there.
