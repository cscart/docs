.. note ::

    This feature is currently in beta status and aimed primarily for testing.

The **Product feeds** feature allows you to export your product catalog to popular deal-aggregating services like Google Shoping, Shopzilla, The Find, etc.

In the **General** tab you can customize export parameters for different deal-aggregating services and export data feeds. More information you can read in the **Help** tab.

Use the **Categories** tab to synchronize categories in your store with that on deal-aggregating services.

Click the **Collect all available product attributes for more detailed feed generation** checkbox in the **Settings** tab to include all product attributes in data feeds.
