.. important ::

    If a customer buys a product that is assigned to a supplier, only the shipping methods assigned to this supplier will be available.

    If a customer buys several products from different suppliers, several shipping methods (assigned to the suppliers) will be used in the order. The shipping cost will be summed.

.. note ::

	When an order is placed, a notification about it will be sent to the corresponding supplier's email so that he could ship the purchased product(s) to a customer.

.. important::

    In order to hide the supplier name in the customer area, the **Display product supplier company** setting needs to be disabled on the **Suppliers** add-on settings page in the **Add-ons > Manage add-ons** section.
